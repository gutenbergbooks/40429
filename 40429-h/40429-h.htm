<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The origin of this little book is as follows: Some
months ago, the expediency was suggested to the author, by certain
prominent friends of hard money in this country, of preparing for
popular reading&mdash;and possibly for political campaign
purposes&mdash;a little tract, or essay, in which the elementary
principles underlying the important subjects of money and currency
should be presented and illustrated from the simplest A B C
stand-point. That such a work was desirable, and that none of the very
great number of speeches and essays already published on these topics
in all respects answered the existing requirement, was admitted; but
how to invest subjects, so often discussed, and so commonly regarded as
dry and abstract, with sufficient new interest to render them at once
attractive and intelligible to those whose tastes disincline them to
close reasoning and investigation, was a matter not easy to
determine.</p>
<p>At last the old idea&mdash;recognized in fables, allegories, and
parables&mdash;of making a story the medium for communicating
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>instruction, suggested itself; and, in accordance
with the suggestion, a remote island community has been imagined, in
which, starting from conditions but one remove from barbarism, but
gradually rising to a high degree of civilization, the progress, the
use, and the abuse of the instrumentalities and mechanism of
exchange&mdash;through barter, money, and currency&mdash;have been
traced consecutively; and the effect of the application of not a few of
the most popular fiscal recommendations and theories of the day
practically worked out and recorded. And, in carrying out this scheme,
the reader will not fail to perceive, by reference to the marginal
notes accompanying the text, that hardly an absurdity in reference to
exchange, money, or currency can be imagined, which somewhere and at
some time has not had its exact counterpart in actual history or
experience.</p>
<p>If any apology for the objects designed or the course pursued is
needed, the author thinks he finds it in the precedent established by
the illustrious Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., who, in the introduction to his
&ldquo;Tales of a Traveler,&rdquo; thus happily sets forth the special
advantage which accrues from the proper employment of a story as a
means of communicating information. &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;for those barefaced tales which carry their moral on their
surface, staring one in the face; on the contrary, I have often hid my
moral from sight, and disguised it as much as possible by sweets and
spices; so that while the simple reader is listening with open mouth to
a ghost or love story, he may have a bolus of sound morality popped
down his throat, and be never the wiser for the fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether in &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s Money&rdquo; the author
shall succeed in inducing his fellow-countrymen&mdash;to whom the
ordinary currency medicine is becoming distasteful&mdash;to swallow
without wry faces the same dose sugar-coated, remains to be
determined.</p>

<h2 class="super">Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s Money.</h2>
<h2 class="label">Chapter I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Three Great Bags of Money.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All who have read &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; (and
who has not?) will remember the circumstance of his opening, some time
after he had become domiciled on his desolate island, one of the chests
that had come to him from the ship. In it he found pins, needles and
thread, a pair of large scissors, &ldquo;ten or a dozen good
knives,&rdquo; some cloth, about a dozen and a half of white linen
handkerchiefs concerning which he remarks, &ldquo;They were exceedingly
refreshing to wipe my face on a warm day;&rdquo; and, finally, hidden
away in the till of the chest, &ldquo;<i>three great bags of
money</i>&mdash;gold as well as silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The finding of all these articles&mdash;the money excepted&mdash;it
will be further remembered, greatly delighted the heart of Crusoe;
inasmuch as they increased his store of useful things, and therefore
increased his comfort and happiness. But in respect to the money the
case was entirely different. It was a thing to him, under the
circumstances, absolutely worthless, and over its presence and finding
he soliloquized as follows: &ldquo;I smiled at myself at the sight of
all this money. &lsquo;Oh, drug!&rsquo; said I, aloud, &lsquo;what art
thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the
ground. One of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>knives is worth all this heap. Nay, I would
give it all for a gross of tobacco-pipes; for sixpenny-worth of turnip
and carrot seed from England; or for a handful of pease and beans, and
a bottle of ink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In introducing this episode in the life of his hero, nothing was
probably further from the thought of the author, De Foe, than the
intent to give his readers a lesson in political economy. And yet it
would be difficult to find an illustration which conveys in so simple a
manner to him who reflects upon it so much of information in respect to
the nature of that which is popularly termed
&ldquo;<i>wealth</i>;&rdquo; or so good a basis for reasoning correctly
in respect to the origin and function of that which we call
&ldquo;<i>money</i>.&rdquo; And in such reasoning, the truth of the
following propositions is too evident to require demonstration:</p>
<p>1st. The pins and needles, the scissors, knives, and cloth were of
great <i>utility</i> to Robinson Crusoe, because their possession
satisfied a great desire on his part to have them, and greatly
increased his comfort and happiness.</p>
<p>2d. Possessing utility, they nevertheless possessed no exchangeable
<i>value</i>, because they could not be bought or sold, or, what is the
same thing, exchanged with any body for any thing.</p>
<p>3d. They had, moreover, no <i>price</i>, for they had no purchasing
power which could be expressed as money.</p>
<p>4th. The money, which is popularly regarded as the symbol and the
concentration of all wealth, had, under the circumstances, neither
utility, value, nor price. It could not be eaten, drunk, worn, used as
a tool, or exchanged with any body for any thing, and fully merited the
appellation which Crusoe in another place gives it, of &ldquo;<i>sorry,
worthless stuff</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the pins, needles, knives, cloth, and scissors were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>all <i>capital</i> to Robinson Crusoe, because
they were all instrumentalities capable of being used to produce
something additional, to him useful or desirable. The money was <i>not
capital</i>, under the circumstances, because it could not be used to
produce any thing.</p>
<p>Starting, then, with a condition of things on the island in which
money had clearly neither utility nor value, let us next consider under
what change of domestic circumstances it could become useful, acquire
value, become an object of exchange, and constitute a standard for
establishing prices.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter II.</h2>
<h2 class="main">A New Social Order of Things.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first person that came to join Robinson Crusoe on
his island was Friday, and next, Friday&rsquo;s father. But even with
this increase of numbers there was still no use for the money, inasmuch
as the three constituted but one family, the members of which labored
and shared all useful things they acquired in common, and made no
exchanges. But when Will Atkins and the English sailors came, and the
population of the island, we may suppose, was largely and permanently
increased, a new social order of things became inevitable.
Incompatibility of taste and temper, and a natural desire for personal
independence, soon made it impossible for all to live and share in
common as one family. And self-interest also soon taught, that, in
order that the quantity of useful things available for the new
community as a whole might be increased, and their quality perfected,
it was desirable, that, instead of each man endeavoring to supply all
his own wants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>and for this purpose following irregularly the
business of a carpenter, baker, tailor, mason, and the like, it was
best for each man to pursue but one occupation, and, making himself
skilled in it, procure the things which he himself did not produce, and
which he might need, by exchanging his own products or services for the
products or services of some other man. They saw instinctively that
Robinson Crusoe, although originally civilized, would, if he had
remained alone on the island, have inevitably become a pure savage, and
simply because he was alone, and could make no exchanges. For a time,
the things which he obtained from the wreck raised him above this
condition; for what the ship brought him&mdash;the knives, axes, guns,
cloth, etc.&mdash;were capital, or the accumulated labor of other men.
But if the ship had given him nothing, he would have had to make every
thing for himself&mdash;&ldquo;his hat, his garments, his
feet-covering, his bread, his meat with bow and arrows, his house by
blows of his hatchet, his hatchet by blows of his hammer, his hammer
heaven knows how&rdquo;&mdash;and become a barbarian in spite of
himself, because all his effort would have been required, and would
have only sufficed, to insure him a bare subsistence.</p>
<p>Systematic division of labor and the exchange of products and
services thus, for the first time on the island, came in, and
constituted a part of the perfected machinery of production, or the
means of getting a living. And it is also to be here noted, that,
because commodities and services now for the first time became
exchangeable, they also for the first time acquired the attribute which
we call <i>value</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Period of Barter.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All exchanges must, however, in the first instance,
have been made directly, or, as we term it, by <i>barter</i>; so much
of one commodity or service being given for so much of some other
commodity or service&mdash;corn for cloth, furs and skins for knives or
tobacco, so much labor in building a house for so much skill in
constructing a canoe. But in all this method of exchanging, which,
while it is the most ancient, is also one which still extensively
prevails in even the most civilized societies, there was no place for
the use or intervention of money; and consequently, also, there was no
such thing as price; for price, as before stated, is the purchasing
power of any commodity or service expressed in money.</p>
<p>But the people on Robinson Crusoe Island soon found out by
experience that there was an obstacle in the way of carrying on all
exchanges according to the principle of direct barter, so serious in
its nature as to constitute, unless removed, a complete bar to any
further considerable progress in civilization and social development.
And the discovery happened somewhat in this wise:</p>
<p>Twist, who was a tailor, and had made a coat, discovered all at once
that he was out of bread; and being hungry, suspended work, and went in
search of Needum, the baker, to effect an exchange. He found him
without difficulty, just heating his oven, and with plenty of bread to
dispose of; but as the baker had all the coats he wanted, he declined
to trade. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Needum, however, kindly informed Twist that if any
fellow should call with any surplus grain or flour, he (Needum) would
be most happy to supply him with all the bread he needed in exchange;
but as the tailor was neither a farmer nor a miller, and had neither of
these articles, he (Twist) set off for the other end of the island,
where there was another baker, to see how the latter was situated in
respect to garments. On his way, Twist was overtaken by Pecks, the
mason, who had no coat, and, wanting the very garment which Twist had
been making, had stopped work on a stone wall and gone in search of the
tailor, to whom he proposed to exchange the coat for a new chimney. But
as Twist had already two chimneys to his house, and nothing to cook,
and didn&rsquo;t want another chimney, the mason was as unsuccessful in
his effort to trade with the tailor as the tailor had been just before
with the baker. At last, after much vexatious traveling about,
involving great waste of time and labor, Twist found a baker who wanted
to exchange bread for the coat, and Pecks a tailor who would give a
coat for a chimney; Needum having, in the mean time, shut up his bakery
and gone in search of Diggs, the farmer, who was willing to supply
grain for bread. But when all these different persons, each desirous of
exchanging his special products or services, had been found, and had
come together, a new perplexity at once made its appearance, and one so
embarrassing as to cause each man seriously to consider whether it were
not better to return home and endeavor to produce every thing for
himself, rather than attempt to exchange any thing. &ldquo;For
how,&rdquo; said they all, &ldquo;is the comparative value of our
different commodities and services which we propose to exchange to be
ascertained?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I know,&rdquo; said Twist,
&ldquo;how many loaves I ought to receive for my coat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Or
I,&rdquo; said Pecks, &ldquo;find out how high and broad a chimney I
ought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>to make for my garment?&rdquo; Diggs, furthermore,
got up a little private dispute of his own with Needum, growing out of
the circumstance that the latter wanted to make his entire payment in
bread to the former at once; while Diggs, who did not relish the idea
of living on stale and possibly moldy bread for an indefinite length of
time, wanted pay for his grain, from the baker, at the rate of one
fresh loaf per day. As for poor Twist, he had become by this time so
humble through hunger that he had not the heart to object to the
proposition to take a cart-load of bread at once in exchange for his
coat, although his house was so small that he knew he would have to
store part of his &ldquo;pay&rdquo; on the roof, where it would be
certain to be eaten by others than his own family.</p>
<p>There was another incident which happened about this time which made
much talk among the island community. A man who had nothing to sell but
his labor had been employed to load a vessel with coal&mdash;a vein of
which had been discovered; and, after working faithfully all day, had
received in pay for his services a ton of coal. But as it was meat,
drink, and lodging, and not coal (although the latter was greatly
needed for some purposes), which the laborer wanted, there was nothing
left for the laborer to do but to attempt to exchange his coal, and
that, too, as soon as possible, in order to satisfy his immediate
necessities. Being too poor to hire a horse and cart, he therefore
borrowed a wheelbarrow, and, filling it with coal, went in search of
persons who had a surplus of meat, drink, and lodgings to dispose of.
But all of them happened to have all the coal they wanted; and morning
found the laborer still trundling through the streets his most useful
commodity unexchanged, and ready to sink with hunger and exposure. A
like experience befell also the journeyman butcher, blacksmith,
carpenter, and dry-goods clerk, who received <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>for
their day&rsquo;s labor respectively a sheep-skin, a dozen horse-shoes,
a piece of pine timber, and two yards of red flannel. All were in no
condition, through bodily exhaustion, to resume work on the next day;
and all also clearly saw that their condition would not have been much
improved, if each had received an entire payment in either meat, drink,
or lodging, in place of coal, skin, lumber, horseshoes, or cloth.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=

<p>The laborers, therefore, held a meeting, and at once resolved:
&ldquo;That whereas it was evident that the system of paying for labor
with a portion of the commodity which each laborer produced would
necessitate as much time and labor to make their wages serviceable to
their wants as was required in the first instance to earn said wages;
therefore, it was but right and proper that the employers should allow
the laborers to use half of the whole time for which they were paid,
for the purpose of rendering their wages wholly available for their
immediate necessities.&rdquo; But to this the employers rejoined that
such an agreement would be equivalent not only to doubling the
proportion of wages to direct production, but also to impairing, to the
extent of one-half, the effectiveness of all labor engaged in
production, thereby increasing scarcity, diminishing abundance, and
rendering further advance in material development exceedingly slow, if
not altogether impossible. For a time, therefore, there was a prospect
of a very serious difficulty between the representatives of labor and
the representatives of capital; resulting, as is always the case, in
immense losses, not only to those directly concerned, but to the whole
community. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">How They Invented Money.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The people on the island&mdash;both laborers and
employers&mdash;were, however, fully agreed that life was too short to
waste a good part of it in a game of
&ldquo;blindman&rsquo;s-buff&rdquo; on a large scale&mdash;for such
this attempt to conduct exchanges on a basis of direct barter
substantially was;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e556src" href="#xd20e556"
name="xd20e556src">1</a> but they nevertheless also clearly perceived
that the game would continue to be played, to the interruption of all
material progress, unless some other method of exchanging could be
devised and adopted. Under the guidance, therefore, as it were, of
instinct (Robinson Crusoe encouraging), <i>and without any enactment of
law</i>, Twist, Needum, Pecks, Diggs, Friday, Friday&rsquo;s father,
Will Atkins, and every body else, by common consent, agreed to select
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>adopt some single commodity which all should agree
to take in exchange for whatever of products or services they might
have to dispose of; so that whenever any one had any thing to exchange,
he might first exchange it for this commodity, whatever it might be,
and then with such <i>intermediate object</i> purchase at such times
and places, and in such proportions as he might desire, whatever he
might need. And the moment this was done, civilization on the island
took a long step forward, and the first great embarrassment growing out
of the attempt to exchange exclusively by direct barter was removed.
The tailor was no longer in danger of starving; the mason had no longer
any anxiety about procuring clothing, and the laborer received as pay
for his labor something which gave him an equivalent in meat, drink,
lodging, and other necessities which he might need, without trouble;
every man giving freely of his goods or services for the intermediate
object, because he knew that every other person desirous of exchanging
would be willing to do the same.</p>
<p>Again: the selection of some commodity or article, and the investing
it by common consent with a universal and comparatively unvarying
purchasing power, also solved the second perplexity, inasmuch as it
provided a measure or standard, for ascertaining the comparative value
or purchasing power of every other exchangeable commodity or service;
and in precisely the same manner as the length or weight of any thing
is ascertained, <i>i.e.</i>, by comparing it with some other thing
which the community have universally agreed to recognize as a standard
of length or weight&mdash;as, for example, the rod of wood which we
call a yard-stick, or a piece of metal which is termed a pound.
&ldquo;My loaves are each worth ten pieces of the intermediate
commodity,&rdquo; said Needum, the baker! &ldquo;My coat,&rdquo;
rejoined Twist, the tailor, &ldquo;is worth a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>thousand
pieces!&rdquo; The terms of fair exchange between the baker and the
tailor would therefore have been one hundred loaves for one coat.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The general name given to the <i>commodities or articles</i> which
the people of different countries universally accept in exchange, as
the equivalent for all other commodities or services, and as the
measure of values, is <i>money</i>.</p>
<p>The commodities or articles which have been selected by men at
various times and places to serve as this universal equivalent,
intermediate agent, or medium for facilitating exchanges, have been
exceedingly various. Among the North American Indians, and the early
settlers who came among them, wampum and beaver-skins were used as
money; among the natives of West Africa, money consists of small shells
called &ldquo;cowries;&rdquo; in Abyssinia, the common money of to-day
is salt; in Chinese Tartary, it is cubes of pressed tea; and within a
comparatively recent period small cakes of soap have been used as money
on the west coast of Mexico. Among pastoral people of antiquity, cattle
and sheep were so extensively used for money that our common English
word <i>pecuniary</i> has its derivation from the old word
<i>pecus</i>, signifying a flock. And while we read in Homer that the
price of the armor of Glaucus was one hundred head of cattle, we also
know that the Zulus of South Africa pay their debts to-day in cattle,
and reckon their wealth by the same standard.</p>
<p><i>Money, therefore, existed before statutes, and exists and is used
to-day among nations who have no written or acknowledged code of
laws.</i></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is also of importance to a clear understanding of this subject to
recognize at this point another fundamental fact, namely, that there is
no evidence that any nation or people has ever adopted, in the first
instance, any article or commodity to use as money which did not
possess, by reason of some inherent or intrinsic desirable qualities, a
natural purchasing power or value. And a little reflection will make it
obvious that this must have been so from necessity. For in the absence
of all law defining what money should be, and regulating exchanges, the
adoption of any article to serve as money which represented little or
no effort for its production or accumulation would enable the shrewd,
the idle, or unscrupulous, easily, and without fear of punishment or
restraint, to take from the rest of the community products which
represented the expenditure of time and labor, without giving in return
any equivalent. Thus, for example, if dried leaves, or pieces of paper
with such marks as any might choose to stamp or scrawl upon them, had
been invested with a universal purchasing power, the primary practical
result of the use of such money would have been to enable somebody to
obtain something for nothing, or to permit those who would not work or
save, to rob those who did. The people on the island, being uneducated,
never did any such foolish thing; but when they came to study history,
they found out, to their great surprise, that the people of other
countries had repeatedly used things worthless in themselves as money;
and many years afterward a man who aspired to be a great teacher even
came to the island from the United States, and endeavored to convince
the people that it was a great defect to use any thing as money which
had any intrinsic value as a commodity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e601src" href="#xd20e601" name="xd20e601src">2</a> The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>children of the first school he attempted to talk
to soon made his position embarrassing by reading from their histories
that the people of every country, especially the poor and ill-informed,
who had ever attempted to facilitate their exchanges by using something
as money which had no intrinsic value, had in every case been so
swindled and robbed, as a consequence, that sooner or later they were
always compelled, as a measure of simple self-protection, to abandon
its use, and in its place adopt something as money which had a
generally acknowledged and comparatively permanent inherent value or
purchasing power as a commodity.</p>
<p>The following were some of the narrations which the children found
and read out of their histories:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In December, 1861, a poor soldier&rsquo;s widow
put into the savings-bank two hundred dollars in specie, and then
removed with four young children to California. In July, 1864, when
gold stood at two hundred and eighty, she sent for her money. In
return, she received a gold draft for eighty-three, accrued interest at
six per cent, included.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Henry
Bronson</span>, <i>Nature and Office of Money</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morals of the people were corrupted (by the Continental
irredeemable money) beyond any thing that could have been believed
prior to the event. All ties of honor, blood, gratitude, humanity, and
justice were dissolved. Old debts were paid when the paper money was
worth no more than seventy for one. Brothers defrauded brothers,
children parents, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"

were paid for money lent in specie with depreciated
paper.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Breck</span>, <i>Sketch of

<p>&ldquo;The assignats gradually dwindled down to nothing, involving
the whole land in ruin&mdash;excepting a few lucky

from its maddened victims.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Notes on the French

<p>&ldquo;In all, from first to last (1835 to 1841), the amount of
notes, bills, drafts, bonds, etc., issued by the Treasury of the
Republic of Texas, and serving to a greater or less extent as a
&lsquo;circulating medium,&rsquo; amounted to $13,318,145, or at the
rate of more than two hundred and sixty dollars per head of the entire
population. If paper issues serving as money could have made a people
rich, the Texans ought to have been the richest people in the universe.
In January, 1839, Texas treasury-notes were worth no more than <i>forty
cents on the dollar</i>; in the spring of 1839, they were worth
thirty-seven and a half cents; in 1841, from twelve to fifteen cents;
and in 1842 it required, in the characteristic language of the times,
&lsquo;fifteen dollars in treasury-notes to buy three glasses of
brandy-and-water without sugar.&rsquo; &lsquo;By this time there was
little circulating medium of any kind in Texas; but this was no great
calamity, as the people had but little left to circulate.&rsquo; The
evils the system did were immense, and such as for which, even were it
so disposed, the Government could afford no compensation to the
sufferers.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Gouge&rsquo;s</span> <i>Fiscal

<p>Again, one of the principal objects for which money was devised and
brought into use was to serve as a measure, or standard, for estimating
the comparative value of other things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>But it seems hardly
possible to conceive of a person desirous of using money for such
purpose, selecting an article to measure values which in itself
possesses no value, or costs no labor to produce, any more than he
would select as a standard for measuring length something which had no
length, or as a standard for measuring weight something which had no
weight. The people of the island must have been unusually stupid if
they did not from the outset, therefore, clearly see that nothing can
be reliable and good money under all circumstances which does not of
itself possess the full amount of the value which it professes on its
face to possess.</p>

people wanted in exchange; and, again (vol. ii., p. 51), he states that
so great was the difficulty of getting things in some of the African

<h2 class="label">Chapter V.</h2>
<h2 class="main">How the People on the Island and Elsewhere Learned
Wisdom.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But while any commodity possessed of acknowledged
purchasing power or value may be used as money, the experience of the
islanders and every other people must have soon taught them that some
commodities are much better adapted to this purpose than others; or,
rather, that the use of certain commodities as money, while they may
answer the purpose, nevertheless entail very serious disadvantages. And
the details of the manner in which this information has been acquired
by experience constitute one of the most interesting chapters in the
world&rsquo;s history. The experience of the islanders was somewhat as
follows:</p>
<p>At the outset they agreed to use cowries&mdash;a pretty shell picked
up on the beach, and which the women all desired to have and use as an
ornament. These shells were not, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>plentiful; and, in fact,
it was found that it required about as much time and labor for a man to
collect a hundred of them as it did to grow a bushel of wheat.
Consequently, wheat regularly exchanged for cowries (as money) at the
rate of one hundred cowries for one bushel, while the farmer with two
thousand cowries could readily buy a plow, which was considered
equivalent in value to twenty bushels. By-and-by, some idle fellows
that were in the habit of sailing made a long excursion, and, for the
first time, visited a little island on the remote horizon. When they
landed, they found, to their surprise, that instead of cowries being
very scarce on the beach, they were very abundant. They winked at one
another, and said little; but each man proceeded to gather all the
cowries he could, and, returning to the main island, kept their
discovery a profound secret.</p>
<p>The first thing of note that next happened among the Robinson Crusoe
people was a great and unexpected revival in business. Money began to
grow abundant. Societary circulation was never so active. Every thing
that was offered for sale speedily found a purchaser, and, demand
increasing, prices rapidly increased also. It was also noticed that a
few persons who never did any regular work, but speculated and gambled
all the morning, and took pleasant sailing excursions every afternoon,
had, especially, plenty of money, which, as patriotic citizens,
desirous of making trade lively, they were always most ready to part
with for other commodities. The shop-keepers, the farmers, and the
mechanics, all also finding that they had more money than usual, all
also felt impelled to buy something, and prices took a fresh start
upward, so that a bushel of wheat that could previously have been sold
for one hundred cowries easily brought one hundred and fifty, and even
two hundred. But, on the other hand, the farmer, instead <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>of being
able to buy, as before, a plow for two thousand cowries, now found that
he had to pay double, or four thousand; or, in other words, the cowries
had only about one-half the purchasing power they possessed before.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e679width" id="p029"><img src="images/p038.png"
alt="Then the bubble burst; stock companies all failed." width="423"
height="490">
<p class="figureHead">Then the bubble burst; stock companies all
failed.</p>
</div>
<p>But for a time every body was jubilant. Was it not evident that the
value of every man&rsquo;s possessions, measured in cowry money, had
greatly increased&mdash;and what could be more natural than that the
shrewd adventurers who had been the authors of these golden days should
be highly honored, invited to speak before cowry clubs in all parts of
the island, and be even talked of for the chief offices, which still
continued to be filled by Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday? The
continually augmenting prices&mdash;measured in cowry money&mdash;of
all commodities, or, what is the same thing, the continually
diminishing purchasing power of the cowries, at last began to attract
attention, and this in turn induced distrust; so that the price of a
bushel of wheat, which had been at first one hundred cowries, and then
two hundred, rose to three, four, and even five hundred cowries.
Another remarkable circumstance noticed was, that, as prices increased,
the wants of trade for cowry money also increased proportionably, which
want the adventurers who had been the means of giving the island its
increased volume of money took care to supply by bringing additional
quantities of cowries as they were needed. It was also observed that,
as distrust increased, there was also a remarkable increase in
societary activity; for every body desired to change off his cowry
money for something else.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e685src" href=
"#xd20e685" name="xd20e685src">1</a> Persons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>who were
in debt made haste to pay their debts, and every body was ready to lend
cowry money to start all sorts of new enterprises. A company was
organized, for example, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>with a capital of ten million
cowries, to explore the wreck of the original ship which brought
Robinson Crusoe to the island; and although nobody knew exactly where
the wreck was, or what was supposed to remain in it, it was advocated
as affording great opportunity for labor. Another project, for which a
company with fifty million cowries capital was started, was to build a
system of canals across the island, although the island had a width of
only about ten miles, with a remarkably safe ocean navigation all
around it.</p>
<p>Finally, the secret of the whole matter gradually leaked out. Other
people besides the original three shrewd fellows found out where the
supply of cowries came from, and made haste to visit the remote island,
provide themselves with money, and put it in circulation. But the more
money that was issued, the more was needed to supply the wants of
trade, until at last it took a four-horse wagon-load of cowries to buy
a bushel of wheat. Then the bubble burst. Stock-companies all failed.
Trade became utterly stagnant. The man whom Robinson Crusoe had made
secretary of the island treasury thought he could help matters by
issuing a few more cowries, but it was no use. Some very wise persons
were certain that every thing would be all right again if people would
only have confidence; but as long as the people who worked and saved
were uncertain what they were to receive for the products of their
labor&mdash;something or nothing&mdash;confidence didn&rsquo;t return.
Every body felt poor and swindled. Every body who thought he had money
in savings-banks woke up all at once to the realization that his money
was nothing but a lot of old shells. Every body had his bags, his
tills, and his money-boxes filled with shells, which he had taken in
exchange for commodities which had cost him valuable time and labor.
Strictly speaking, however, calamity did not overtake every body.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>There were some exceptions, namely the shrewd and
idle fellows who had first found the cheap supply of cowries, and,
taking advantage of the ignorance of the community, had added them to
the before-existing circulation to serve as money. All these had taken
very good care to keep the substantial valuable things&mdash;houses,
lots, plows, grain, etc.&mdash;which they had received in exchange.
They had, in fact, grown rich by robbing the rest of the
community.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e701src" href="#xd20e701" name=
"xd20e701src">2</a> The community, however, were too courteous to call
them thieves, and in conversation they were usually referred to as
shrewd financiers, and as men ahead of their time. The concluding act
of this curious island experience was, that the formerly so highly
prized money became depreciated to such an extent as to possess value
only as a material for making lime. The people accordingly, by burning,
made lime out of it, and then, in order to make things outwardly
cheerful, used the lime as white-wash. But upon one point they were all
unanimous, and that was, that the next commodity they might select to
use as money should be something whose permanency of value did not
depend on elements capable of being suddenly affected by accidental
circumstances, or arbitrarily and easily changed by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the
devices of those who desired to get their living without working for
it.</p>
<p>But this experience of the islanders in reference to the originating
and using of money, although curious, has not been exceptional; for the
records of history show that men almost everywhere, in going through
the process of civilization, have had a greater or less measure of the
same experience. One particularly noteworthy illustration of this is
recorded in the &ldquo;History of New York,&rdquo; by Diedrich
Knickerbocker, and in the manuscript records of the New York Historical
Society. It was in the days of Dutch rule&mdash;1659&mdash;in New
Amsterdam (afterward New York), when the common money in use was the
so-called Indian money, or &ldquo;wampum;&rdquo; which consisted
&ldquo;of strings of beads wrought of clams, periwinkles, and other
shell-fish. These had formed a simple currency among the savages, who
were content to take them of the Dutch in exchange for
peltries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Kieft was at that time governor, and being desirous of
increasing the wealth of New Amsterdam, and withal, as the historian
relates, somewhat emulous of Solomon (who made gold and silver as
plenty as stones in the streets of Jerusalem), he (the governor)
determined to accomplish his desire, and at the same time rival Solomon
by making this money of easy production the current coin of the
province. &ldquo;It is true, it had an intrinsic value among the
Indians, who used it to ornament their robes and moccasins; but among
the honest burghers it had no more intrinsic value&rdquo; than bits of
bone, rag, paper, or any other worthless material. &ldquo;This
consideration, however, had no weight with Governor Kieft. He began by
paying all the servants of the company, and all the debts of the
Government, in strings of wampum. He sent emissaries to sweep the
shores of Long Island, which was the Ophir of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>this
modern Solomon, and abounded in shell-fish. These were transported in
loads to New Amsterdam, coined into Indian money, and launched into
circulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for a time affairs went on swimmingly. Money became
as plentiful as in the modern days of paper currency, and, to use a
popular phrase, &lsquo;a wonderful impulse was given to public
prosperity.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the success of Governor Kieft&rsquo;s scheme, the
Yankees on Connecticut River soon found that they could make wampum in
any quantity, with little labor and cost, out of oyster-shells, and
accordingly made haste to supply all the wampum that the wants of trade
in New Amsterdam required; buying with it every thing that was offered,
and paying the worthy Dutchmen their own price. Governor Kieft&rsquo;s
money, it is to be further noticed, had also in perfection that most
essential attribute of all good money,
&ldquo;<i>non-exportability</i>.&rdquo; Accordingly, when the Dutchmen
wanted any tin pans or wooden bowls of Yankee manufacture, they had to
pay for them in substantial guilders, or other sound metallic currency;
wampum being no more acceptable to the Yankees in exchange than addled
eggs, rancid butter, rusty pork, rotten potatoes, or any other
non-exportable Dutch commodity.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e725src"
href="#xd20e725" name="xd20e725src">3</a></p>
<p>The result of all this was, that in a little time the Dutchmen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>and the Indians got all the wampum, and the
Yankees all the beaver-skins, Dutch herrings, Dutch cheeses, and all
the silver and gold of the province. Then, as might naturally have been
expected, confidence became impaired. Trade also came to a stand-still,
and, to quote from the old manuscript records, &ldquo;the company is
defrauded of her revenues, and the merchants disappointed in making
returns with which they might wish to meet their engagements.&rdquo; It
is safe to conclude that, after this, the commodity made use of by the
Dutchmen as money was something less liable to have its value impaired
than wampum.</p>
<p>The early settlers in East Tennessee also came to a similar
conclusion, after a somewhat similar experience. Raccoon-skins were in
demand for various purposes, and consequently were valuable. They
accordingly selected them for use as money. Opossum-skins, on the other
hand, were not in demand, and therefore had little value. Those of the
settlers who desired to discharge their obligations without giving a
full equivalent paid their taxes in opossum-skins to which coons&rsquo;
tails were attached. The counterfeits having once got into the
treasury, could not be exported out of the treasury to meet the
payments of the State, and the use of coon-skins as currency came to an
end.</p>
<p>But to return to the island. Although the first experience of the
islanders in selecting a commodity to be used as money had been
particularly unfortunate, the necessity of having some agency to serve
the purpose of money remained as great as before, and consequently a
new commodity had to be selected. Various people proposed various
things. Some proposed to use bananas, which were always desirable, and,
when good and ripe, were always exchangeable at a very constant value;
but their unfitness to be used as money was acknowledged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>as soon
as it was pointed out that bananas decayed very quickly after they
became most useful, and that therefore a man who had plenty of money
to-day might have none tomorrow, and that through no fault of his
own.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e748src" href="#xd20e748" name=
"xd20e748src">4</a> Wheat, cattle, and pieces of stamped iron were also
proposed, but all of these were found to be unsuitable in some
essential particular. Thus, for example, it was objected to wheat,
that, though it was almost always in demand, and represented a very
constant amount of labor for its production, it was too bulky to carry
about, and rarely had the same exact value one year as another; to
cattle, that it was impossible to divide up an ox, cutting off the tail
at one time and the ears at another, for the purpose of making change,
without destroying the value of the animal as a whole; and that if cows
in general were to be used as legal tender to pay debts, the very
poorest cow would very probably be selected from the money-pen for such
a purpose;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e757src" href="#xd20e757" name=
"xd20e757src">5</a> while, if iron were adopted as money, and
circulated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>at its current value, it might be necessary to
move about a ton to pay a debt of twenty or thirty dollars.</p>
<p>A peculiar kind of beads, made of blue glass, had come into use with
the women on the island as ornaments, and being greatly in demand,
small in bulk, and of most durable material, they were thought to be
peculiarly well fitted to serve the purpose of money. They were
accordingly adopted, and for a time fairly answered the purpose. But
all at once the women declared their continued use to be unfashionable;
and all use and demand for the beads at once ceasing, the merchants and
others who had accumulated a large stock of them, in exchange for other
commodities, at the same moment found that what they had regarded as
money had no longer any purchasing power or value, and in consequence
experienced great losses. Thereupon the community concluded not to use
blue glass beads any longer as money.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e770src" href="#xd20e770" name="xd20e770src">6</a></p>
<p>How fast the people on the island, by reason of their varied
experience, educated themselves up to a knowledge of what constitutes
good money may be inferred from the following incident:</p>
<p>A portion of the inhabitants on the island were heathen, and, to
defray the expense of efforts to civilize and Christianize them, it was
the habit of certain good men to take advantage of the assembling of
the people from time to time to solicit and receive contributions for
such objects. It was observed, however, on such occasions that some
persons, either through ignorance of what constitutes money, or by
reason of great poverty, were in the habit of depositing commodities in
the hat which were not money; and the practice having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>been
brought to the attention of Robinson Crusoe (who generally presided at
such meetings), he is reported to have administered rebuke and
instruction in the following impressive manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before proceeding to take up our regular contribution for the
heathen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would suggest to the
congregation&mdash;and more especially to those who sit in the
gallery&mdash;that the practice of putting into the hat commodities
which are not money, more especially buttons, shows a degree of
ignorance respecting the uses of money on the part of some in this
community which I had not supposed possible, after all our recent and
varied experience on this subject. But if, through ignorance or
impecuniosity, any should feel obliged to continue to contribute
buttons in the place of money, I would request that they do not stamp
down or break off the eyes; inasmuch, as while by so doing they utterly
destroy the utility of these commodities as buttons, and do not
increase their desirability as money, they also utterly fail to deceive
the heathen; who, although ignorant of the Gospel, and not using
buttons for any purpose, are nevertheless, as a general thing, good
judges of currency.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=

<p class="first">Finally, time and circumstances helped the islanders
to a solution of their difficulties. A man, walking in a ravine one
day, picked up a small bright mass of shining metal. Although it had
evidently lain in the sand, been washed by the water, exposed to the
atmosphere, and rubbed against the rocks, nobody knows how long, it had
a remarkable brightness and color; and the more it was rubbed, the
brighter and more attractive it became. This little mass of metal,
which afterward came to be designated as gold, the man carried home to
his wife, who in turn was so much pleased with it that she hung it by a
string about her neck as an ornament. Its attractiveness of course
excited the desire of every other woman to have the same, and a further
search in the ravine resulted in the discovery of other nuggets. Closer
examination of the new metal also showed that it possessed many other
remarkable qualities besides brightness. It was found it could easily
be melted and cast, and also be readily molded without heat by
hammering and pressing; and that when so cast, molded, and pressed, it
persistently retained the shape and impression that were given it.
Further, that it could be drawn into the finest of wire, hammered into
the thinnest of plates and leaves, and be bent and twisted to almost
any extent without breaking; that an admixture with it of the slightest
impurity or alloy so immediately changed its color, that color became
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>to a very high degree a test of its
purity;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e791src" href="#xd20e791" name=
"xd20e791src">1</a> that fire, water, air, and almost all the agencies
destructive to other things, had comparatively little or no effect upon
it; that with the exception of size and weight, every piece, no matter
how small, possessed all the attributes of every other larger piece;
and that when any large piece was divided into a great number of
smaller pieces, these last, in turn, could be reunited without loss or
difficulty again into one whole. Of course, the discovery of all these
remarkable qualities united in one substance not only greatly increased
its utility, but at the same time greatly increased the desire of every
body to have it. In place of being worn in a rough state as an
ornament, it was converted into rings, bracelets, chains, pins, etc. It
was found to be almost indispensable for a great number of mechanical
and chemical purposes; and, finally, the charm for its possession and
desire for its use proved so overpowering <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>that to many it actually
became almost an object of worship.</p>
<p>If a man was a Pagan, he felt that in no way could he so honor and
symbolize the god he worshiped as to fashion in gold the image of that
which he imagined; if he was a Christian, he chose gold for the
fabrication of his symbolic vessels and ornaments, as, of all material
things, the one which was most typical of purity, beauty, durability,
and worth. If a great government or a people desired to commemorate the
deeds of a hero or statesman, it impressed their effigies in medals of
gold; if a maxim was enunciated which by general consent embodied the
best rules of life, it was called golden; if a law or precept was
thought worthy of being kept in ever-present remembrance before the
people, it was emblazoned in letters of gold; while for speech,
prophecy, or poetry, this same metal has ever been a never-failing
source for the finest of comparisons and the most attractive of
figurative illustrations. In short, from the time of its first
discovery, among all nations, in all countries, with the ignorant and
the learned, the savage and the civilized, the rich and the poor, the
humble and the powerful, gold has always been, of all material things,
the one which most men have desired most; the one for which, under most
circumstances, they have been willing to exchange all other material
possessions, and for the sake of acquiring which, even part with
immaterial things of greater value&mdash;honor, creed, morality,
health, and even life itself.</p>
<p>Gold so becoming an object of universal desire to the people on the
island, and made exchangeable for all other things, it soon acquired
spontaneously a universal purchasing power, and from that moment became
<i>Money</i>.</p>
<p>This purchasing power was at first by no means fixed or constant. So
long as there was but a small quantity of gold, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>its
purchasing power was large. As the quantity extracted from the rocks or
washed from the sands became greater, and the wants of the people
became more and more satisfied, its purchasing power or value
decreased; and if the supply had continued, and the demand had been
limited to the wants of the island exclusively, its value in time would
have undoubtedly been no greater than copper or iron, and possibly not
so great. But, very curiously, an abundant supply did not continue.
That which was obtained first and with little labor proved to be the
result of the decay and washing of the rocks through long ages; and
when the readily accessible or surface deposits became exhausted, as
was soon the case, the conditions determining the supply of gold became
altogether different. On the one hand, there was no lack of gold.
Instead of being a very scarce metal, as was for a time supposed, it
was found to be so widely disseminated that the chemists and
metallurgists readily detected traces of gold in almost every extensive
bed of clay and sand they examined.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e807src"
href="#xd20e807" name="xd20e807src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, on the other hand, experience also proved that to collect any
very considerable quantity of the metal required the expenditure not
only of a vast amount of most disagreeable and exhausting labor, but
also of a great quantity of other commodities. So that the people who,
at the outset, abandoned their various occupations of raising wheat,
making coats, building boats, baking bread, and constructing stone
walls and chimneys, and betook themselves to digging gold, soon learned
that, as a general rule, the results of a day&rsquo;s labor thus
employed purchased no more of useful or desirable
commodities&mdash;meat, drink, clothes, etc.&mdash;than the results of
a similar amount of labor exerted in the most ordinary occupations; and
not a few even were ready to assert, as the result of their individual
experience, that a man could do better for himself in the way of
earning a living by following any and every other occupation rather
than that of seeking for gold.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e818src" href=
"#xd20e818" name="xd20e818src">3</a> Accordingly, after trying it for a
little while, the most skilled laborers left the gold regions and went
back to their old occupations; and these, in turn, were followed by the
unskilled laborers in such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>numbers, that had it not been for the
encouragement growing out of the hope of suddenly enriching themselves
through the chance discovery of a great nugget (as sometimes happened),
the mines would have been entirely deserted. As it was, the supply of
gold greatly fell off, and, the demand for it remaining about the same,
the purchasing power of the stock on hand for other commodities
gradually increased, until it came about that the result of an average
day&rsquo;s labor in digging gold was found to buy <i>more</i> than the
result of an average day&rsquo;s labor in other occupations. But as
soon as this was observed, an additional supply of labor went back to
gold-mining, and continued to follow it, until an equalization of
results from effort in gold-digging and effort in other corresponding
employments was again established, as before related. And this
interchange of employments and equalization of results from labor went
on, year by year, until at last the people, as it were by instinct,
found out that a given quantity of gold represented more permanently a
given amount of a certain grade or kind of human labor or effort than
any other one substance. And the moment this fact became apparent, the
people on the island for the first time also clearly perceived that
gold, in addition to the universal exchanging quality or purchasing
power which it had before naturally acquired, from the circumstance
that every body from the time of its first discovery wanted it, had
further acquired two other attributes, which fitted it, above all
things else, to serve as money; namely, and <i>first</i>, that it had
become a measure or standard of value, by which, as by a yard-stick,
the comparative value of all other commodities might be measured or
estimated; and, <i>second</i>, that its value or purchasing power was
so constant and continuously inherent in itself, even under
circumstances when the value of most other commodities would be
destroyed, that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>greatest security or guarantee which any
person owning gold could possibly have of its remaining valuable to him
for any length of time was, that the owner should simply keep
possession of it.</p>
<p>By no portion of people on the island was this last attribute
regarded so much in the light of a blessing as by the poor old men and
women. As a general rule, they earned but little more than sufficed to
support them, and they were therefore always naturally very anxious
lest what little they saved should be impaired in value or made
worthless by keeping, before the time when they might especially need
it to pay for doctors and medicine, or insure them a decent burial. The
cowry money, which had before represented their hard toil and personal
deprivation, had turned out, on keeping, to be only worthless shells;
the bead money had become valueless when it became unfashionable; the
cattle money had to be fed every day to keep it from experiencing a
heavy discount, and penned up every night to prevent it from walking
off; the wheat money was always liable to be injured by damp or
devoured by vermin; while twenty pounds of pig-iron had proved too
heavy for their old limbs to carry to the store every time they wanted
to purchase a little cloth or tobacco. But here was something at last
which completely satisfied the necessities of their situation, and
enabled them to feel certain that, whether they buried it in the
ground, where it was always damp and moldy; or put it in the chimney,
where it was always hot and smoky; or lived at one end of the island
among the heathen, or at the other end among the Christians, would
always, year in and year out, buy about the same average quantity of
all sorts of things; and which, when offered in payment for services or
commodities, to the doctor, lawyer, merchant, druggist, undertaker,
mason, or tailor; to the Yankee, Irish, Dutch, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>Turk, or
Hindoo; to the governor of Ohio, or a senator from Indiana, did not
require any of them to look in a book, examine a law, read the Bible,
or hunt up the resolutions of the last Congress or political
convention, to tell how much it was worth, or whether it was safe to
take and keep it.</p>
<p>There was a very wise man on the island who objected to the use of
gold as money, for the reason that he felt afraid that the poor old
women who wanted to feel certain of having always something of reliable
value in their possession would fill their old stockings with it and
hoard it.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e841src" href="#xd20e841" name=
"xd20e841src">4</a> But he was soon shut up by some one asking him,
why, if the old women wanted to keep something by them perfectly secure
against a rainy day, and slept better nights because they knew they had
it, they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed that privilege? and if there could
be any possible reason why any one should object to the old women
hoarding gold, except that he wanted to cheat and wrong the poor by
compelling them to keep their hard-earned savings in something whose
value was not certain, and which might have no value whatever when it
came time to pay the doctor or the undertaker?</p>
<p>When the people on the island first began to use gold as money, they
carried it around with them in the form in which it was first found;
the fine dust or scales inclosed in quills, and the nuggets in bags; or
they melted and hammered it into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46"
href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>large lumps and bars;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e851src" href="#xd20e851" name="xd20e851src">5</a>
and, as the purchasing power of the gold was always proportioned to its
weight and purity, every body carried round with him small scales and
tests with which he proved the gold before making exchanges with it
(the same as is customary at the present day in China). But this method
involved great inconveniences; and although the statement of a person
of recognized honesty that he had proved the value of the gold he
offered in payment was generally accepted, it was nevertheless
recognized that there was no more unfairness or discourtesy in the
claim of the grocer to test the quality of the money of his customer by
scales and acids, than there was in the claim of the customer to test,
by tasting, the salt and sugar of the grocer. As might be inferred,
therefore, it often required a good deal of time to complete the most
ordinary exchanges, and people everywhere complained about it and wrote
letters to the newspapers. Merchants who were very cautious and
particular, irritated their customers, and got the reputation of being
very exacting and distrustful; while merchants who had but little
capital and wanted to get business, advertised they would take gold on
the simple word of their customers. But it was observed of the last,
that, owing to being constantly cheated, they all, sooner or later,
failed. At last the difficulty was remedied by a series of happy
circumstances.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe had, some years before this, died, at a good old
age, as had also Will Atkins, and all the sailors who had come with him
to the island from other countries; so that there were none now on the
island who had ever known any thing about or ever seen any coined
money. In making some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>public improvements, however, a party of
workmen one day broke into the old cave in which Crusoe had first lived
when he escaped from the shipwreck, and there, in the dirt beneath the
floor, were discovered the three great bags of money which Crusoe had
found in the chest, and in his disgust had buried and utterly
forgotten. Every body at once recognized the metal to be gold, and was
perfectly willing to exchange other commodities for it with the
finders, the same as he was willing to do for any other gold. But why
it should be in the form of flat round disks, and stamped with
inscriptions and images, was something that puzzled every body; and the
Antiquarian and Philosophical Society called a special meeting to
discuss the subject. Some, looking to only one side of the pieces,
thought they were medals struck to commemorate some distinguished man,
or a woman, whose name often appeared to be &ldquo;Liberty.&rdquo;
Others, who looked only at the other side, thought they were intended
to signalize a great contest between the lion and the unicorn, or to
make the people familiar with the peculiarities of some unnatural bird
or beast, which, as it was not like any thing either in the heavens, or
on the earth, or in the waters under the earth, it might not be sinful
to worship.</p>
<p>At last, after the flat disks or coins had been for some time in
circulation, and the community had found out, by repeatedly weighing
and testing them, that each disk represented a constant weight of gold
of uniform purity, the idea came at once to every one that the only use
of the fanciful images and inscriptions on the disks was to officially
testify to the fact of their uniformity of weight and value; and then
every body wondered that he could have been so stupid as not to have
before recognized the idea and adopted it, in place of every man
weighing, cutting up, and testing his gold every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>time he
desired to part with or receive it in making an exchange. An
arrangement was accordingly at once made for a public
establishment&mdash;afterward called a mint&mdash;to which every person
who so desired could bring his gold and receive it back again after it
had been divided into suitable pieces of determinate weight and
fineness; the fact that the weight and fineness of each piece had been
so proved being indicated by appropriate marks upon the metal. And in
this manner &ldquo;coined money&rdquo; first came into use on the
island. And by this time, also, the money which Robinson Crusoe found
in the chest, and which, when it first came into his possession, had
neither <i>utility</i>, <i>value</i>, nor use as a <i>standard</i>, or
<i>measure of value</i>, had gradually acquired all these several
attributes: <i>utility</i>, when the material of which it was composed
became capable of satisfying some human desire for it, as an ornament,
as a symbol of worship, or for some mechanical or chemical purpose;
<i>value</i> (the sole result of labor), when it became an object
<i>of</i> or equivalent <i>in</i> exchange, or acquired a power of
purchasing other things; a <i>standard</i>, or <i>measure of value</i>,
when its purchasing power, by reason of various circumstances, was
found to be, if not absolutely permanent, at least more permanent, on
the average, than that of any other commodity.</p>
<p>The conversion of money into coin was something purely artificial,
and the result of law, or statute enactments, the sole object of which
was simply to make the money (previously in use) true and in the
highest degree convenient. But, as has already been pointed out, money
came into use in the first instance without statute, and was the
result, as it were, of men&rsquo;s instincts; and the subsequent choice
by them of gold, in preference to any other commodities for use as
money, was for reasons similar to those which induced men to choose
silk, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>wool, flax, and cotton as materials for clothing;
and stone, brick, and timber as materials for houses. It was the thing
best adapted to supply the want needed.</p>
<p>The introduction and use of coined money at once gave an impetus to
business, and made the people richer, because it saved time and labor
in making exchanges, and relieved every man from the trouble and
expense of buying and carrying round with him scales and other tests.
The only persons dissatisfied were the scale-makers, who found their
business almost destroyed, and they petitioned the authorities to have
their interests protected by the enactment of a law compelling all
persons to weigh their coins with scales before exchanging, as formerly
they did their gold. But, as every body at once saw that the effect of
such a law would be equivalent to compelling all exchangers to do
useless work, the petition amounted to nothing.</p>
<p>For convenience in speaking and writing, also, each piece of gold or
coin of determinate weight and fineness regularly issued by the mint
received a particular name and had a particular device impressed on it.
Thus, for example, the piece of lowest denomination, containing 25.8
grains of standard gold, which had on it a likeness of Crusoe&rsquo;s
old and faithful servant, was called a &ldquo;Friday;&rdquo; a piece of
ten times its weight and value, with a small portrait of the founder of
the island community, was called a &ldquo;Crusoe;&rdquo; and a piece of
double the weight of the last, or twenty times the weight of the first,
with a large portrait on it, was called a &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;double Crusoe.&rdquo; Some time after, when the island
became generally known to the rest of the world, it was found that
these coins exactly corresponded in weight, fineness, and value with
those adopted in that foreign country called the United States, and
there known under the names of the gold dollar, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>eagle,
and double-eagle; and after a time, for the purpose of favoring the
development of civilization and assimilating nationalities by the
adoption of a common monetary standard, it was agreed to discard all
local sentiments, and to substitute the latter names for the
former.</p>

the mints there is exhibited as a curiosity a case in which this fact
is demonstrated in the most striking manner. It contains some fifty or
more very thin ribbons, or strips, of gold, half an inch wide by three
inches in length, placed in a row, parallel to, but separated from each
other by a slight interval. The first ribbon is composed of gold of the
highest standard of purity; the second differs from the first to the
extent of one per cent. of admixture with a baser metal; while the
third contains two per cent., the fourth three per cent., and so on,
until in the last ribbon, or strip, the amount of gold and alloy is
equal. The color of the first ribbon is, in the highest sense of the
term, golden or typical. The color of the second differs from the first
by a shade, which shade in every successive ribbon changes and becomes
more and more marked as the proportion of alloy entering into its
composition increases: and so peculiar are these differences of color
that it is possible for an individual unskilled in metallurgy, but
having access to the standard, to make a comparatively accurate test of
the purity of any article of gold in his possession by a simple
comparison of color.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e807" href="#xd20e807src" name="xd20e807">2</a></span> In 1862 Mr.
Eckfelt, then principal assayer at the mint in Philadelphia,
communicated to the American Philosophical Society the result of some
exceedingly curious examinations demonstrating the very wide
distribution of gold. The city of Philadelphia, he stated, was
underlaid by a bed of clay having an area of about ten square miles,
with an average depth of about fifteen feet. Specimens of this
clay&mdash;all natural deposits&mdash;taken from such localities as
might furnish a fair assay of the whole&mdash;the cellar of the market
on Market Street, near Eleventh, and from a brick-yard in the suburbs
of the city&mdash;all yielded, on careful analysis, small amounts of
gold; the average amount indicated being seven-tenths of a
grain&mdash;or about three cents&rsquo; worth&mdash;of gold for every
cubit foot of clay. Assuming these data to be correct, the value of the
gold, according to Mr. Eckfelt, which lies securely buried underneath
the streets and houses of Philadelphia must therefore be equivalent to
$128,000,000; or if we include all the clay contained in the corporate
limits, the amount of gold contained in it must be equal to all that
has yet been obtained from California and Australia.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;It is also apparent,&rdquo; says Mr.
Eckfelt, &ldquo;that every time a cart-load of clay is hauled out of a
cellar in Philadelphia, enough gold goes with it to pay for the
carting; and if the bricks which front our houses could have brought to
their surface, in the form of gold-leaf, the amount of gold which they
contain, we should have the glittering show of two square inches on
every brick.&rdquo;</p>

without so much risk of getting rheumatism, gold-washing on the Rhine
is not often adopted as a regular employment.</p>

<p class="first">Next came the consideration of the laws regulating the
exchanges and the use of money. Some people wanted laws enacted that
every person should be obliged to sell and part with any thing he
owned, provided a nominal or real equivalent in what the State should
declare money should be offered him; and, also, that when any person
had bought commodities and services of another, and had promised to pay
for them after a time, he might fully discharge the obligation by
tendering that which the State said was money, no matter whether in the
mean time the persons in charge of the mint had, for any reasons, taken
out one-half the valuable gold in the coins, and substituted in its
place comparatively worthless lead.</p>

alt="The survival of the fittest." width="433" height="567">
<p class="figureHead">The survival of the fittest.</p>
</div>
<p>But, to the honor of the islanders, these propositions met with
little favor. They said, we mean to be an honest and also a free
people; and, therefore, every one in buying or selling shall do exactly
what he has agreed to do; unless, by reason of some unforeseen or
unavoidable circumstances, he is absolutely unable to perform his
agreement or contract. And they said, further, that if any one receives
commodities and services, and promises to give, five years or five
minutes afterward, in return, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>an agreed-upon quality and quantity
of gold, wheat, cod-fish, or cabbages, it shall be considered, as in
truth it is, dishonest to attempt to discharge the obligation by
offering pig-iron in the place of gold, pease or beans in the place of
wheat, soft-shell crabs in the place of cod-fish, or pumpkins in the
place of cabbages; and any community which shall in any way sanction
any such evasion of the letter or spirit of its obligations can have no
rightful claim to call itself an honest, Christian people; and if any
community enacts and maintains laws <i>compelling</i> any person to
receive in exchange, or in pay for his services or products, something
which he did not agree to and would not otherwise receive, such a
community has no rightful claim to call itself a free community. The
people on the island, therefore, decided that they would allow the
island authorities to interfere with exchanges to this extent only:
that the medium of exchange and measure of values that they had adopted
and called a Friday, or a dollar, should always and under all
circumstances contain 25.8 grains of standard gold; that this standard
should never be departed from; and that although no one should be
compelled to use it, yet whenever any one talked about or promised to
pay or give money, without specifying whether the money should be
wampum money, bead money, cattle money, gold money, or any other
particular kind of money, the money issued by the acknowledged
authorities of the island should be understood and accepted as what was
meant. In short, like sensible men, the islanders concluded that as
long as they maintained in common use a real, good, and true money,
which carried on its face evidence (easily read and known of all men)
of its value or purchasing power, there was little use of cumbering up
the statute-book with any thing about legal tender. They would leave
that to other people wiser than they were, who desired <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>to use
money that would not circulate, except it had some artificial power or
agency back of it to make it go.</p>
<p>After this, every thing for a time pertaining to trade and commerce
went on very smoothly on the island. It is true there were bad persons
who obtained commodities and services on credit for which they never
intended to pay; careless and extravagant persons who bought more than
they were able to pay for; and foolish and oversanguine people who,
after having by labor and economy accumulated a good store of
commodities, exchanged them for shares in enterprises which never could
pay. And when people by one or more of such methods lost the results of
their hard labor and toil, they naturally felt depressed, lost
confidence in their fellow-men, and thought times and things might be
improved by turning all those in office out, and putting new men in.
But no one on the island ever for a moment imagined that there was any
way to honestly replace the money they had lost, except by acquiring
through industry and economy a new store of useful commodities with
which to buy money; and no one who ever had any thing to sell which
others in the community wanted, and were able to give in return a fair
equivalent, ever found himself in want of money or a market; while, on
the other hand, no one who had nothing to sell which the community
wanted or were able to pay for ever succeeded in obtaining either money
or a market. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=

<h2 class="main">How the People on the Island Came to Use Currency in
the Place of Money.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As time went on, changes in the method of doing
business gradually occurred on the island. Instead of being an isolated
and unknown community, their existence as an organized, civilized state
became generally known to the rest of the world, and a brisk trade and
commerce resulted from the exchange of the products of the island for
the products of other countries. An excellent harbor existed at each
end of the island, and about these points the population naturally
aggregated, and built up two very considerable towns. The middle of the
island, on the other hand, was elevated into high mountain ranges,
covered with dense forests, in crossing which travelers journeying
between the two cities were often robbed of all the gold they carried
about them. To obviate this danger, and avoid the necessity of carrying
gold, persons living at opposite ends of the island, therefore, adopted
a system of giving written orders for money on each other, which each
reciprocally agreed to pay to the person whose name was written in the
order or draft, and then periodically settled or balanced their
accounts by offsetting one order or payment against another. In this
way value or purchasing power was transmitted long distances much more
cheaply and conveniently than could be effected by the transmission of
gold itself; and also much more safely, inasmuch as the thieves could
make no use of the orders, even if they obtained them. And thus it was
that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>people on the island became acquainted with and
first used what were afterward known as &ldquo;<i>bills of
exchange</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e939src" href=
"#xd20e939" name="xd20e939src">1</a></p>
<p>This labor-saving and danger-avoiding device, moreover, proved so
useful, that the idea soon suggested itself that by an extension of the
principle involved in the bill of exchange the necessity of carrying
gold at all in any quantity might also be avoided. A public office was
therefore established, where people might deposit their gold under the
guardianship of the state, and receive a ticket or receipt for the
amount, payable in coin on demand; which tickets, from the fact that
every body knew that they were convertible into gold at will, and that
no more tickets were issued than corresponded to gold actually
deposited and retained, soon came to be regarded as equally good and
valid as gold itself, and vastly more convenient for the purpose of
making exchanges. And thus it was that <i>currency</i> (from the Latin
<i lang="la">curro</i>, to run) originated and came into use on the
island as a substitute and representative of money.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e950src" href="#xd20e950" name="xd20e950src">2</a> The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>name originally given to these receipts was first
&ldquo;bank-credits,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;bank-notes,&rdquo; but
after a time people acquired a habit of designating them as
&ldquo;paper money.&rdquo; But this latter term was conceded to be but
a mere fiction of speech and a bad use of language; for every
intelligent person at once saw that a promise to deliver a commodity,
or an acknowledgment of the receipt of, or a title to, a thing, could
not possibly be the commodity or the thing itself, any more than a
shadow could be the substance, or the picture of a horse a horse, or
the smell of a good dinner the same as the dinner itself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as an instrumentality for transferring commodities
used for money, and avoiding the loss and waste unavoidable in handling
and transporting such commodities, the currency thus devised was a
great invention, and being always represented by, or, as we may express
it, covered with, the commodity&mdash;gold&mdash;which, of all things,
fluctuates least in value, it perfectly answered the purpose of money,
without actually being so. It also furnished another striking
illustration of the superiority of the commodity gold to serve either
as money or as an object of value for deposit, against which receipts
or certificates of deposit might be issued to serve as currency; for if
other valuable commodities, like cattle, corn, cloth, or coal, had been
selected for a like purpose, the bank would have been obliged to erect
large pens, sheds, and warehouses for the storing of the deposits; and,
let them be guarded ever so carefully, their value or purchasing power
would, after a time, rapidly diminish from natural and unavoidable
causes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span></p>

alt="A shadow is not a substance." width="416" height="488">
<p class="figureHead">A shadow is not a substance.</p>
</div>
<p>The value of most commodities, even in a perfect condition,
furthermore differs so much by reasons of mere locality, that there
could be no possible uniformity in the value of the receipt for the
deposit of one and the same article, issued by banks in different
places, to serve as currency; the value or purchasing power of a ton of
coal, or a fat ox, being one thing at the mouth of a coal-mine or on a
prairie stock-farm, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>quite a different thing ten, twenty,
or a hundred miles distant. But in the case of gold, the space needed
to store up what represents a vast value is very small, while the value
or purchasing power of gold not only is, but is certain to remain, on
the average, very constant all the world over.<a class="noteref" id=

Historically, bills of exchange probably originated with the Jews of
the Middle Ages, who, ever liable to persecution, adopted a system of
drafts, or written orders, upon one another, which each agreed to honor
and pay to the person named in the draft.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e950" href="#xd20e950src" name="xd20e950">2</a></span> It was in
this manner that the first bank of which we have any record originated
in 1171, namely, the Bank of the Republic of Venice. Venice in that
year was at war and needed money. The Council of Ten, or the
Government, called upon the merchants to bring in their gold or coin
into the public treasury, and gave credit on the books of the state for
the amounts so deposited; which credits carried interest (always
promptly paid) at the rate of four per cent. per annum. Soon after the
establishment of this bank one of the depositors died; and it becoming
necessary to distribute his estate among five children, his bank-credit
was divided into five portions and transferred to five new owners. A
system of transferring bank-credits was thus introduced, and proved so
useful that in a brief time the merchants adopted it very generally as
a means of paying balances in all great business transactions. The
banks of Amsterdam and of Hamburg were also subsequently established on
substantially the same basis, and are doing business to-day
successfully. The Bank of Venice did business for five hundred years;
during which period the state was prosperous, and there were few
failures among the mercantile classes.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e969" href="#xd20e969src" name="xd20e969">3</a></span> If to any
it may seem puerile and unnecessary to enter into such explanations, it
may be well to remind them that one of the schemes for a new currency,
which has of late found some earnest advocates in the United States, is
that of Josiah Warren, of Ohio, who proposed that currency
&ldquo;should be issued by those men, women, and children who perform
useful service&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, grow corn, mine coal, catch
cod-fish, pick up chestnuts and the like&mdash;&ldquo;but by nobody
else;&rdquo; such results of service being deposited in safe
receptacles, and having receipts of deposit issued against them to
serve as &ldquo;equitable money.&rdquo; A further axiom of Mr. Warren
was, &ldquo;that the most disagreeable labor&rdquo; (not the most
useful) &ldquo;is entitled to the highest compensation;&rdquo; and,
therefore, inferentially entitled to issue the most money. A specimen
of this equitable money before the writer reads as follows:</p>
<div class="q boxed">
<p class="footnote first xd20e128"><i>The most disagreeable labor is
entitled to the highest compensation</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"><b>$1.00</b></p>
<p class="footnote">Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p class="footnote xd20e128"><i>Due to Bearer</i>,<br>
EIGHT HOURS&rsquo; LABOR,<br>
<i>In Shoe-making, or a Hundred Pounds of Corn</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote xd20e996"><span class="sc">William
Morton</span>.</p>
<p class="footnote">No. &mdash;, F&mdash;&mdash; Street.</p>
<p class="footnote"><b>Time is Wealth.</b></p>
</div>
<p class="footnote">Of course, to make this money equitable, and its
issue, as claimed, &ldquo;the satisfactory solution of the great
problem of labor and capital,&rdquo; there must be some presupposed
equitable relation between eight hours of shoe-making and a hundred
pounds of corn. But one hundred pounds of corn in Illinois are the
result of only a quarter as much labor as a hundred pounds in New
England; and what comparison is there between eight hours&rsquo; work
of a skilled mechanic and that of a mere cobbler in making shoes? or of
the man who performs a disagreeable, slavish piece of work, and of the
genius who invents or makes a machine that makes this disagreeable work
unnecessary?</p>
<p class="footnote">E. D. Linton, of Boston, one of Warren&rsquo;s most
eminent disciples, improves on Warren&rsquo;s ideas, and proposes that
the United States Government should prepare and issue a currency, which
should read as follows:</p>
<div class="q boxed">
<p class="footnote first"><i>The United States will pay One Dollar to
Bearer, on demand, in &mdash;&mdash; bushels of Illinois Fall Wheat, at
United States No. 1 Store-house, No. 12 River Street, Chicago,
Ill.</i></p>
<p class="footnote xd20e128">This note is receivable for all debts due
the United States.</p>
</div>
<p class="footnote">And the same inferentially in respect to pigs,
coal, shoes, and the services of doctors, lawyers, and cooks. So, then,
if the note is not to be on its face a lie, and the promise is to be
actually performed on demand, the necessity will be absolute on the
part of the Government of the United States to have store-houses for
wheat at Chicago, pig-pens at Peoria, coal-mines or d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts
at Pottsville, and trained professionals ready on call to plead a case,
preach a sermon, cure a cold, and cook a dinner; and all of these last
must take their pay in pigs if required. But as a pig has one value at
Peoria, and another value at almost every other place, the
dollar&rsquo;s worth of pig which the United States would pay might be
a whole pig in one place, a half in another, and possibly only the
snout in another.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">War with the Cannibals, and What Came of It.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But more serious matters than the making and issuing
of money soon claimed the attention of the people of the island. It
will be remembered that Friday was first brought to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>island
by the cannibals, for the purpose of being cooked and eaten, and that
he was rescued from this fate by the valor of Robinson Crusoe, as was
subsequently also Friday&rsquo;s father and others of his countrymen.
But the cannibals, although then repulsed, did not at the same time
lose their appetites, or the remembrance of the good cheer that had
escaped them; and meat becoming scarce in their own country, they
projected a grand invasion of the island, with the intent of capturing
and cooking Friday, if he was still there, or, in default of Friday,
any body and every body they might happen to catch. The islanders all
at once, therefore, found themselves precipitated into a terrible war,
and were obliged to struggle not only for their homes, but for their
individual existence.</p>
<p>The Government was active and energetic, but to carry on the war a
vast expenditure of commodities was necessary; and as the Government of
the island&mdash;in common with all other governments&mdash;never had,
or could have, any commodities or money to buy commodities with, other
than what it obtained through loans and taxes, the people, one and all,
were called upon to help. There was, however, some fear that if the
calls for help were put in the form of taxes, the fires of patriotism
might not burn as brightly as was desirable, and it was therefore
deemed expedient to say little about taxes at the outset, and rely
mainly on loans, to be repaid after the war was over.</p>
<p>The people, on their side, responded most cheerfully. Some gave one
thing and some another. Some gave service as soldiers, laborers, and
artificers; others contributed timber for canoes, cloth for tents, iron
for spear-heads and guns, corn and flour, hay, medicines, and
money&mdash;in short, all sorts of useful things, the results of
previous labor and economy on the part of the individual contributors.
In return, the contributors received <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>back from the Government
a promise, expressed on paper, to repay the commodities borrowed, or
their value in money. These promises were of two kinds. In one the
promise was made definite as to the time of its fulfillment, and the
amount or value of the promise carried interest. These were called
<i>bonds</i>. In the other, the promise, although definite, specified
no particular time for making it good, and its amount or value was not
subject to interest. These latter, from the circumstance that they were
written on blue paper, were popularly termed &ldquo;bluebacks.&rdquo;
When the people got the bonds, they put them carefully away, for the
sake of the interest that would accumulate upon them; but when they got
the bluebacks, they were at first at a loss to know what to do with
them. They were in some respects unlike any thing they had ever seen
before; and yet there was a very close resemblance between them and the
certificates of deposits of gold in the public repository, which they
had now been in the habit for some time of using as currency. And as
the one promised, on the part of the Government, to pay money equally
with the other, there seemed to the public to be no good reason why one
should not be used as the representative and equivalent of money as
readily as the other.</p>
<p>The real difference was, that their former currency, composed of
tickets or certificates given in exchange for a deposit of actual gold,
represented an actual accumulation of an equivalent of every thing
desirable which labor could produce all the world over; while, on the
other hand, the promises to pay which the island authorities issued in
ex- change for the commodities loaned them by the people, and
subsequently used up in fighting the cannibals, represented an actual
destruction of almost every thing useful and desirable in place of
accumulation. The people, however, did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>see
this; and by reason of not seeing it they continued to accept and
regard the promises to pay, which represented loss and destruction, as
the same thing as money, and naturally also as wealth; and as the
creation and issue of this sort of money or wealth increased as
destruction increased, they finally, one and all, came to the
conclusion that the more and faster they destroyed, the richer they
should all be; and that, by a happy series of accidents, they had at
last solved that great problem which the world had so long been anxious
about&mdash;namely, &ldquo;of how to eat your cake and at the same time
keep it.&rdquo; And, as a further illustration of the extent to which
this idea acquired a hold upon the public mind, it may be mentioned
that some of the most popular books which were published about this
time on the island had the following suggestive titles: &ldquo;<i>A
National Debt a National Blessing</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t Pay
as you Go, a sure Way to Get Rich</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Pulling at your
Boot-straps the best Way to Rise in the World</i>,&rdquo; and the
like.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one great reason which encouraged the people of the
island in their delusion was the circumstance that the Government
promises to pay, although they had ceased to represent accumulation, or
a definite equivalent of any thing in particular, did not thereby cease
to be instrumentalities for effecting exchanges; but, on the contrary,
continued to constitute great labor-saving machines, performing a work
precisely similar in character to that performed by a ship or a
locomotive&mdash;namely, the removal of obstacles between the producer
and consumer. But, in becoming <i>a representative of a debt to be
paid</i> in place of representing <i>a means of paying a debt</i>, the
new currency lost at once the really most important quality of good
money; inasmuch as it ceased to be a <i>common</i> equivalent, or <i>in
itself an object of value</i> in exchange, and therefore became
incapable of properly discharging the function of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>a
standard, or measure, for estimating the comparative value of other
things; resembling, in this deficiency, a ship without a rudder, or a
locomotive without a track to run on. The removal of a rudder from a
ship, or the taking up the track in front of a locomotive does not
impair the capacity of the one for cargo, or the power of the other for
pulling. But if it is attempted to use a ship or a locomotive under
such circumstances for the purposes for which they were
constructed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as agencies for effecting and
facilitating exchanges&mdash;the result of their work will be so
uncertain and hazardous that the owners of the things to be exchanged
would require large insurance against the possible action of the
exchanging agencies. And so it was with this blueback currency of the
island, which, ceasing to represent or be convertible on demand into a
constant quantity of any commodity, ceased to be a constant equivalent
or measure of value of any thing.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>If the news came one day that the cannibals had been repulsed, a
given number of the bluebacks would buy a bushel of wheat. If the news
came the next day that the black troops, although they had fought
nobly, had been driven back, and that there was some prospect that
every body, sooner or later, would be cooked and eaten, then the same
number of bluebacks bought only half the quantity of wheat.
Consequently, every body, in selling commodities representing
expenditure of time and labor, added to the price of the same, in order
to insure himself against the fluctuations of the purchasing power of
the currency he received; or, in other words, to make sure that what he
received should remain, for a greater or less length of time, the
equivalent of what he gave. But as no one could tell what the cannibals
were likely to do from day to day, and therefore what were to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>the fluctuations in the purchasing power of the
currency, every body in selling any thing felt that he incurred a risk,
in addition to the risks usually attendant upon ordinary buying and
selling. And as the data for estimating these risks were just as
uncertain as the data for estimating the results of dice-throwing,
every body guessed at the amount of insurance needed, or, what is the
same thing, <i>bet</i> on the purchasing power of the currency at
future periods. An abnormal gambling character, therefore, necessarily
became a part of every business transaction, and worked to the great
detriment of all that class of people on the islands, who had only
labor to sell, which loses its entire value for the time, if not bought
at the moment it is offered for sale, and the selling price of which,
when once established, can only be changed with difficulty. And as this
was a very important matter in the financial history of the island, it
is desirable to illustrate it by relating the details of what actually
happened:</p>
<p>The people on the island clothed themselves largely in cloth made in
foreign countries; and as the island currency was non-exportable, the
cloth was paid for by exporting gold, or commodities which could
readily be exchanged in other countries for gold. The cloth thus
purchased with gold was made up into clothing by the
&ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; clothing dealers in the cities, and sold in
this form for currency, to smaller or retail dealers on a credit of
from three to six or nine months. Had the currency involved in this
transaction throughout been gold, or certificates representing deposits
of gold, the credit price of the ready-made clothing would have been
the <i>cash</i> price, with a small amount additional to represent
interest on the credit-time, and a possible risk of non-payment; and
the seller would never for one moment have taken into consideration the
question whether the currency, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>or representation of money in
which he was to be paid, three, six, or nine months afterward, would
have the same value or purchasing power that it had on the day the debt
was contracted. He might have doubted whether his customer would pay
him at all, but he never would as to the quality of that which he was
entitled to receive as payment. But as the currency involved in so much
of the transaction as occurred after the cloth was made into clothing
was neither gold nor any thing which represented gold, nor any other
valuable commodity, and therefore, like a ship without a rudder, or a
locomotive without a track, was sure to be unreliable as an exchanging
instrumentality, the seller knew to a certainty that <i>what</i> he was
to receive in payment of his goods, three, six, or nine months
afterward, would not have the same value or purchasing power that it
had on the day the debt was contracted. It might be greater, it might
be less; but the seller never bet on the former contingency, or allowed
for it by deducting any thing from the time price of his goods, for to
do so would be to discard in anticipation a possible incidental profit.
But he always, as a matter of safety, felt obliged to <i>bet</i> on the
latter contingency, and then cover the bet by adding correspondingly to
the price of every thing he sold on credit. When, by reason of the
disturbed condition of things, the purchasing power of the currency
fluctuated greatly in brief intervals, the seller on all his time sales
<i>bet</i> in favor of great risks, and <i>bet</i> differently every
day, and added ten, fifteen, twenty, or even thirty per cent. to his
prices over and above the general aggregate representing cost, profit,
interest, and ordinary risk, in order to make sure of receiving
currency of sufficient purchasing value to enable him to buy back as
much gold as he was obliged to give for the cloth originally.</p>
<p>When, on the other hand, the fluctuations in the purchasing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>power of the currency became limited, the
insurance percentage added to price became also limited, and followed a
somewhat general rule. Thus, when a clothing-dealer sold goods on
<i>three months&rsquo;</i> credit, for currency whose purchasing power
was so much less than gold that it took one hundred and fifteen of
currency to buy one hundred in gold, he added <i>five per cent.</i> to
his sale price, or he bet that the depreciation of currency at the end
of three months would be indicated by one hundred and twenty for gold;
while for a credit longer than three months he bet that the risk of
depreciation would be greater, and added, to cover this risk, an
average of <i>ten per cent.</i> to his price. If now, at the end of
<i>three</i> months, it required one hundred and twenty-five in
currency to buy one hundred in gold, the dealer lost five per cent.
through the payment of his debt. But if, on the other hand, the
fluctuation of the purchasing power of the currency was the other way,
and it required at the end of the three months only one hundred and ten
of currency to buy a hundred in gold, he made ten per cent. over and
above his ordinary and legitimate profit, while an equivalent burden or
loss fell on the consumers.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1121src" href=
"#xd20e1121" name="xd20e1121src">1</a> As the dealers were shrewd, the
result of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>betting and insurance was rarely loss, and so
constantly profit, that some dealers after a while came to regard the
obtaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>of this species of profit as the main thing for
which all business was instituted; while others, more clear-headed and
discerning, concluded that the wisest and easiest way to get rich was
to bet <i>directly</i> on the varying quantity of currency which it
would take from day to day to buy the same quantity of gold, or other
valuable commodities, instead of attempting to do the same thing
indirectly, through the agency of stores, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>stocks of goods, clerks,
books, credits, and the like. The last, accordingly, wound up their
business, and, in the language of the day, &ldquo;<i>went on to the
street</i>,&rdquo; and made their living by selling on time what they
did not possess, and buying on time what they never expected to
receive, and reckoning profit or loss according to the difference in
prices growing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>out of the fluctuations of the currency between
the day of buying or selling, and the day of receiving or delivering.
In short, as with the magic fiddle in the fairy tale, which, when
played upon, made every body dance, no matter whether in the brambles
or on the plain, so the use on the island of a currency which
continually fluctuated in purchasing power, because it was not a
constant equivalent of any thing, made every body gamble that could;
some because they liked to, and others because they had to, to protect
themselves from losses. The masses who could not conveniently gamble
tried to protect themselves by asking high prices in return for their
services, or by giving less in proportion to what they
received;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1187src" href="#xd20e1187" name=
"xd20e1187src">2</a> but, in the long run, they learned by hard
experience that they were not as well off as they expected to be; and
that if one effect of an overabundant, non-equivalent-to-any-thing
currency was to stimulate production, another and greater effect of it
was to unequally distribute the results of production, transferring
from those who had little to those who had much, and thus making the
rich richer, and the poor poorer.</p>

Although, to all who have investigated the subject, the evidence is
conclusive that an irredeemable fluctuating paper money is always made
an agency for taxing with special severity all that class of consumers
who live on fixed incomes, salaries, and wages, it has, nevertheless,
always been a somewhat difficult matter to find illustrations of the
fact so clear and simple as carry conviction by presentation that it
does thus act to the classes most interested. With a view of obtaining
such an illustration, application was made some months since to an
eminent American merchant, whose large and varied experience abundantly
qualified him to discuss the subject; and the result of the application
may be thus stated:</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Q.</i> In buying in gold and selling in
currency, what addition do you make to your selling price, in the way
of insurance, that the currency received will be sufficient&mdash;plus
profit, interest, etc.&mdash;to replace or buy back the gold
represented by the original purchase?</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>A.</i> We do but very little of that now; hardly
enough to speak about.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Q.</i> But still you make insurance against
currency fluctuations an item in your business to be regarded to some
extent?</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>A.</i> Why, yes, certainly; it won&rsquo;t do to
overlook it entirely.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Q.</i> Well, then, if you have no objections,
please tell me what you do allow under existing circumstances?</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>A.</i> I have certainly no objections. We buy
closely for cash; sell largely for cash, or very short credit; and,
within the comparatively narrow limits that currency has fluctuated for
the last two or three years, add but little to our selling prices as
insurance on that account&mdash;say one to two per cent. for cash, or
three months&rsquo; credit; and for a longer credit&mdash;if we give
it&mdash;something additional. During or immediately after the war,
when the currency fluctuations were more extensive, frequent, and
capricious, the case was very different. Then selling prices had to be
watched very closely, and changed very frequently&mdash;sometimes
daily. My present experience, therefore, is exceptional; and to get the
information you want, you must look further. I think I can help you to
do this. We buy regularly large quantities of a foreign
product&mdash;let us suppose, for illustration, <i>cloth</i>, for the
large manufacturers and dealers in ready-made clothing. We buy for
gold, and we sell for gold, and do not allow the currency or its
fluctuations to enter in any way into these transactions. But how is it
with <i>my</i> customers? I allow them some credit; and the amount
involved being often very large, I, of course, must know something of
the way in which they manage their business. They transform the cloth,
purchased with gold, into clothing; and then sell the clothing, in
turn, to <i>their</i> customers&mdash;jobbers and retailers&mdash;all
over the country, for currency, on a much longer average credit than
they obtain from me for their raw material. As a matter of safety and
necessity, these wholesale dealers and manufacturers must add to their
selling prices a sufficient percentage to make sure that the currency
they are to receive at the end of three, six, or nine months will be
sufficient to buy them as much gold as they have paid to me, or as much
as will buy them another lot of cloth to meet the further demands of
their business and their customers. How much they thus add I can not
definitely say. There is no regular rule. Every man doubtless adds all
that competition will permit; and every circumstance likely to affect
the prospective price of gold is carefully considered. Five per cent.,
in my opinion, on a credit of three months would be the average
minimum; and for a longer time, a larger percentage. If competition
does not allow any insurance percentage to be added, there is a
liability to a loss of capital, which, in the long run, may be most
disastrous&mdash;a circumstance that may explain the wreck of many
firms, whose managers, on the old-fashioned basis of doing business,
would have been successful. The jobbers and the retailers, to whom the
wholesale dealers and manufacturers sell, are not so likely to take
currency insurance into consideration in fixing their selling prices;
but to whatever amount the cost price of their goods has been enhanced
by the necessity of insurance against currency fluctuations, on that
same amount they estimate and add for interest and profits; the total
enhancement of prices falling ultimately on the consumer, who, of
necessity, can rarely know the elements of the cost of the article he
purchases.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Q.</i> So Mr. Webster, then, in his remark,
which has become almost a proverb, that &ldquo;of all contrivances for
cheating the laboring classes, none has been more effectual than that
which deludes them with paper money,&rdquo; must have been thoroughly
cognizant of the nature of such transactions?</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>A.</i> Most undoubtedly; for such transactions
are the inevitable consequence of using as a medium of exchange a
variable, irredeemable currency.</p>

place of being imaginary, is based on the actual condition of business

a ship was built in New York, at the time when labor and materials,
reckoned in currency, had touched their highest prices. In 1870,
another ship was built in the same place and on the same
model&mdash;like the former in every particular. It was expected that,
as wages and the cost of materials were less in 1870 than in 1864, the
cost of the latter ship would be much less than that of the former; but
the result showed that this was not the case.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter X.</h2>
<h2 class="main">After the War.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At last the war ended. The cannibals were utterly
repulsed; and the islanders no longer laid awake nights for fear of
being roasted and eaten. A vast amount of every thing useful had,
however, been necessarily destroyed; and it would seem as if this
admitted fact would have made the people of the island feel poor. But,
very curiously, it did not. The promises to pay for the commodities
destroyed had all been preserved. They were regarded by almost every
body as money; and if money, then, of course, as every body knew, they
were wealth, and wealth so great and superabundant that the one thing
especially necessary to do was to devise plans for using it. Every
body, therefore, devised plans; those who had no money more especially
devising plans for those who had. All sorts of schemes were accordingly
entered upon; railroads to carry people to the isothermals and every
other place where they didn&rsquo;t want to go; and oil-wells on Cheat
and Al(l)gon(e)quin rivers, and patented inventions for making
substitutes for tea and coffee, being especially recommended as
permanent investments. John Law, Lemuel Gulliver, Baron Munchausen, Sir
John Mandeville, Juan Ferdinand Mendez-Pinto, and Sindbad the Sailor,
all came to town, and were chronicled in the newspapers as having
registered at the principal hotels.</p>
<p>Great and commendable industry was also displayed in replacing the
things destroyed by the war, so that, for a time, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>the
societary circulation became more brisk than ever; while some who had
up to this time regarded war as a misfortune and national calamity, now
felt that they had made a mistake; and others who had known all the
time that war was a blessing, seriously thought of proposing another
war as a means of increasing national prosperity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1206src" href="#xd20e1206" name="xd20e1206src">1</a> The large
and constant investment of the results of labor and economy in
enterprises which never could by any possibility give back any adequate
return, was, as every body saw, the next best thing to war; and on the
advice of the most Christian newspapers, very many of the best people
made haste to make such use of their little savings; although, as
agriculturists, they were perfectly well aware that to plant seed wheat
or corn in soils where it would not come up, or, coming up, bear no
fruit, was always very bad business, and did not encourage the sower to
hire much additional labor the next year.</p>
<p>Another idea which about this time had become very popular on the
island was, that while it was a very desirable thing to sell as much as
possible of the products of the island to people in other countries, it
was not desirable to buy any thing from foreigners in return, and that
it was wise to put all possible obstructions in the way of any
ill-informed persons who desired to make such exchanges. But as no one
can long continue to buy unless he proportionally sells, or sell unless
he proportionally buys, the foreign commerce of the island soon came to
a stand-still; and what also notably helped to this result was, that
the necessity of insuring all exchanges made through the medium of the
unstable currency of the island <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>caused all the island products
to cost from <i>five</i> to <i>ten</i> or <i>fifteen</i> per cent. more
than they otherwise would, and more than they would cost the foreigners
to buy elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1222src" href="#xd20e1222"
name="xd20e1222src">2</a> But as every industrious community
(especially if it calls in the aid of the forces of nature through
machinery) produces more than it consumes; and as the islanders were
both industrious and ingenious, it oddly enough happened that the
community became sorely troubled by an accumulation of useful things,
which the manufacturers would not part with, because they were
unwilling to sell at a loss, and which the foreigners would not buy
because they could buy cheaper elsewhere, and pay in their own products
for what they bought. Then the manufacturers stopped producing, and
next the laborers, by lack of employment, being unable to buy a full
share of the existing abundance, in turn diminished their consumption;
so that for a time it seemed as though the island would get into the
condition of those unfortunate people who die of their own fatness.</p>

<p class="figureHead">This scheme accordingly found many opponents, who
alleged that, if it were carried out, it would deprive them of money,
and consequently of instrumentalities for making their exchanges.</p>
</div>
<p>In this way the times gradually &ldquo;got out of joint.&rdquo;
Gradually the people on the island came to realize that much which they
had considered as wealth was not wealth, and that many influences,
before little regarded, were powerfully acting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>to make
and keep them poor. All were satisfied that the currency which they
were using was one prime cause of their difficulties, but in precisely
what manner the currency exerted an influence few agreed. All were of
one mind, that they ought to talk about it continually; and they
accordingly did <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>so, those who knew the least talking the most.
Some thought that the honest thing to do, and because honest the best,
was for the Government of the island to redeem its promises to pay on
demand as rapidly as possible; that where they had borrowed a canoe of
one man, cloth of another, spears of a third, or money of a fourth,
they should return them, and not keep promising and never doing. But
even these did not agree as to the manner of thus paying. Some thought
it was best to return the canoes, the iron, the cloth, and the money
from day to day as the Government gradually acquired them. Others
thought that a better way would be to accumulate each separate thing in
a separate warehouse, and then when the warehouses had, after some
years, become full, open the doors, and return every man what had been
borrowed of him all at once. But, as before pointed out, the Government
never had, or could have, any canoes, cloth, iron, or money, except
such as it obtained from the people; and, therefore, payment on the
part of the Government was really the same thing as payment on the part
of the people. But payment of debts is something to which many people
are constitutionally opposed; and this scheme accordingly found many
opponents, who alleged that, if it were carried out, it would deprive
them of money, and consequently of instrumentalities for making their
exchanges; while the real trouble with many of this class of people
was, that they hadn&rsquo;t any thing useful, the products of their own
industry, <i>to exchange</i>, and therefore could get no money, unless
they went to work, or, what was preferable, acquired it from somebody
without consideration.</p>
<p>Besides the persons referred to, who either openly or by their
indecision opposed fiscal reform, there were various other classes of
obstructives. There were those, for example, who, during the war, were
always friends of peace, dressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>in broad-brimmed hats and drab
coats, and were at any time ready to compromise with the cannibals, on
condition that the latter should be satisfied with roasting and eating
only the old men, the babies, and an occasional mother-in-law. All
such, as a part of their peace policy, opposed the original issue and
circulation of the bluebacks as something arbitrary, illegal, and
unnecessary. When, however, the cannibals were driven away, these
&ldquo;friends of peace in time of war&rdquo; at once changed their
Quaker garb; became &ldquo;friends of war in time of peace;&rdquo;
declared earnestly for the enlarged issue and continued use of the
bluebacks, and, as a pretext for so doing, were willing, if necessary,
to have another war, or, at least, an annual scare. During the war,
these friends of peace were called &ldquo;copper-heads;&rdquo; and
after the war, their copper-headism, although disguised, was
substantially the same thing. For it was apparent that opposition to
the issue of the bluebacks, as manifested by the advocates of peace
during the war, and opposition to their payment and withdrawal after
the war, were only different manifestations of hostility to the
Government and to the war itself: inasmuch as failure on the part of
the Government to observe its promises, made under such circumstances
of extreme peril, would manifestly put it in bad repute, and prevent it
from ever resorting to similar measures in like emergencies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1252src" href="#xd20e1252" name="xd20e1252src">3</a>
The really intelligent and patriotic men of the island at once saw
through this duplicity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"
name="pb78">78</a>]</span>and repudiation, advocated under pretense of
extreme solicitude for the wants of trade. They remembered the old
couplet:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd20e1257">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would
be;</p>
<p class="line">When the devil got well, the devil a monk was
he;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1262src" href="#xd20e1262" name=
"xd20e1262src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">and thereafter designated the opponents of paying the
bluebacks, as inflated, or elongated, copper-heads, by which name they
were ever after known in history.</p>
<p>There were also many well-meaning citizens, who sincerely desired to
have the balloon of inflation come down, but strenuously objected to
have this result effected by any diminution of the volume of gas
contained in it. All the first-cousins of the man who waited for the
river to run by before crossing were certain the balloon would come
down, if people would only be patient, keep a sharp lookout, and wait.
But to this it was objected, that if people were obliged to consume a
large part of their time in watching the balloon, to avoid having their
heads smashed by its swayings and fluctuations, there would ultimately
be a scarcity of victuals and drink; and that, rendered desperate with
watching, and want of employment, food, and clothing, those interested
would finally insist on pulling open the valves, and letting the whole
volume of gas escape at once. Some proposed to imitate the example of
&ldquo;Peter the Headstrong&rdquo; in fighting the Yankees, and bring
down the balloon by proclamation; while others professed to have great
faith in family prayer. Eminent patriotic constitutional lawyers
maintained that the military necessity that authorized and created the
bluebacks must necessarily limit their duration solely to the period of
their military <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>necessity; and that their continued re-issue and
use after the repulse of the cannibals was but a prolongation of the
war&mdash;not against the enemy, but against their own people. The
astute elongated copper-head lawyers held, on the other hand, that an
instrument of military necessity, once created, remains such an
instrumentality for continued use for all time; and, therefore, that a
bullet or shell, once lawfully employed for effecting destruction in
time of war, could legitimately be reissued or reshot in time of peace,
without matter as to whom it might hit or what property it might
destroy; and that, in fact, to go on reloading and refiring these
instruments, and thereby killing and destroying, were not crimes, but
high acts of patriotism. This theory, however, alarmed some timid
people, who said that one shell or one bullet thus re-used indefinitely
might destroy all the property, or kill all the people on the island;
and they rather regretted, in view of such a construction, that they
did not at once succumb to the cannibals, whose appetites, in time,
might have become cloyed, or whose diet might have been changed through
indigestion or moral suasion.</p>
<p>In the period of doubt and perplexity which thus came to the
community, those fond of precedents carefully searched the old
chronicles and records of other nations for lessons of experience; and,
among various things which profited them greatly, they found, among the
chronicles of the learned Spanish historian, Fray Antonio Agapida, the
following account of what the veteran soldier, Don Inigo Lopez de
Mendoza, Count de Tendilla, did, when, besieged by the Moors in the
town of Alhama, he had also serious financial difficulties to contend
with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened,&rdquo; says Agapida, &ldquo;that this Catholic
cavalier, at one time, was destitute of gold and silver wherewith to
pay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>the wages of his troops; and the soldiers murmured
greatly, seeing that they had not the means of purchasing necessities
from the people of the town. In this dilemma, what does this most
sagacious commander? He takes me a number of little morsels of paper,
on the which he inscribes various sums, large and small, according to
the nature of the case, and signs me them with his own hand and name.
These did he give to the soldiery, in earnest of their pay.
&lsquo;How!&rsquo; you will say, &lsquo;are soldiers to be paid with
scraps of paper?&rsquo; &lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; I answer, &lsquo;and
well paid, too, as I will presently make manifest; for the good count
issued a proclamation ordering the inhabitants of Alhama to take these
morsels of paper for the full amount thereon inscribed, promising to
redeem them at a future time with silver and gold, and threatening
severe punishment to all who should refuse. The people, having full
confidence in his word, and trusting that he would be as willing to
perform the one promise as he certainly was able to perform the other,
took these curious morsels of paper without hesitation or demur. Thus,
by a subtile and most miraculous kind of alchemy, did this Catholic
cavalier turn worthless paper into precious gold, and make his late
impoverished garrison abound in money!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but just to add,&rdquo; continues the historian,
&ldquo;that the Count de Tendilla redeemed his promises, like a loyal
knight; and this miracle, as it appeared in the eyes of Agapida, is the
first instance on record of paper money.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<p>It may be also remarked that the island antiquarians did not find
any chronicle of any other soldier who imitated Count de Tendilla in
issuing &ldquo;little morsels of paper&rdquo; to serve as money, and
subsequently did not imitate him in promptly redeeming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>his
promises, who found it easy to obtain again the confidence of the

their existence as a federated nation, have been in a state of war;
and, for the future, there is no good reason for supposing that the

it has been in the past. With irredeemable paper, violation of plighted

<p class="first">At last there arose a sect of philosophers (calling
themselves Friends of Humanity) who felt confident of settling all
difficulties, and who also aspired to the government of the island.</p>
<p>Their chief had the reputation of being an ogre. He had served in
the war against the cannibals, looked exceedingly fierce, and therefore
was accounted brave; he talked loud and with great assurance, and
therefore he was accounted wise; he had acquired great riches without
ever doing any thing useful, and therefore he was accounted skilled in
business.</p>
<p>His principal associates and counselors were two. The first was a
great orator, who had spent most of his life as a missionary among an
uneducated people who never had any property, and, of course, made no
exchanges; and in this most excellent and practical school had learned
all that could be acquired on this complicated subject. The second was
a great athlete, who had performed for many years in the national
circus, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>and had acquired great reputation by carrying
weighty packages on both shoulders, labeled &ldquo;domestic
industry,&rdquo; but which in reality contained only pig-iron. About
these two &ldquo;every one that was in distress, every one that was in
debt, and every one that was discontented gathered themselves,&rdquo;
so that they soon had a large body of disciples.</p>

height="508">
<p class="figureHead">The doctors prescribe continued low (fiscal)
diet.</p>
</div>
<p>The first thing they did was to abuse poor old Robinson Crusoe,
because he had advised his people, in his life-time, to make their
money of gold (which can be only produced by labor, and not by
hocus-pocus); and their currency of something that represented gold,
and this, too, when he must have known that gold &ldquo;was the
machinery and relic of old despotisms;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1321src" href="#xd20e1321" name="xd20e1321src">1</a> and they
made no account whatever of the fact that he was the father of his
country and lived in a cave. Next they declared that all the opinions
heretofore accepted on this subject by the rest of mankind were
fallacious; that nature had done its best to make the island an
isolated community; that legislation had pretty effectually
supplemented whatever in this respect nature had left deficient; and,
therefore, that the wants of the island, in respect to money, currency,
and every thing else, were so exceptional and peculiar that the
accumulated experience of all the rest of the world could not be to
them either applicable or instructive. All agreed that the pernicious
theory taught by Robinson Crusoe, Friday, and other men of by-gone days
and other countries&mdash;that money, to be good, ought to be a
universally desirable commodity, and the equivalent of that for which
it is exchanged&mdash;was the real source of all financial trouble; for
was it not clear, that, if such were the case, those only could ever
have money who, like the bloated wheat-holders, pig-holders,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>cattle-holders, house-holders, or bond-holders,
had through labor previously come into possession of some desirable
things, which they could give in exchange as an equivalent for money?
while the true end of all financial reform, and the key to the terrible
problem of poverty, was obviously to devise and bring into use that
kind of money which those who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>no wheat, pigs, cattle, houses,
bonds, or other commodities, and were not able or disposed to acquire
any through an exchange of their services, could have without
difficulty, and in abundance. &ldquo;We mean, therefore,&rdquo; said
the orator-philosopher, speaking for himself and his colleague Friends
of Humanity, &ldquo;to have more democracy and less aristocracy in the
money market; more money in every body&rsquo;s reach, and less for the
petted few.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1328src" href=
"#xd20e1328" name="xd20e1328src">2</a> In short, the patient having
become very sick and attenuated by reason of the low (fiscal) diet upon
which he had been fed, the doctors now proposed to resuscitate him by
administering a still thinner gruel.</p>
<p>All also agreed that the word &ldquo;money&rdquo; was a bad name,
and that the public would obtain a much clearer idea of the great
problems at issue if more intelligible and scientific terms embodying
definitions were used. One philosopher accordingly proposed that, as
they intended to sprout it everywhere, they should go back to the
Biblical designation, and call it the &ldquo;root,&rdquo; at the same
time remarking that &ldquo;the Lord showed what he thought of money by
the kind of people he gave it to.&rdquo; Another proposed to call it
&ldquo;the instrument of association&rdquo; (Carey); a third, the
&ldquo;sign of transmission, of which the material shall be of native
growth&rdquo; (John Law, 1705); a fourth, &ldquo;a sense of value as
compared with commodities&rdquo; (&ldquo;British Tracts on
Money,&rdquo; 1795&ndash;1810); a fifth, &ldquo;a standard neither gold
nor silver, but something set up in the imagination to be regulated by
public opinion&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>
<p>As to what money, under the reform system, was, or should be, was
also a question in respect to which there was not at first an entire
agreement. One idea which found some favor, was, that money ought to be
only a token, representative of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87"
href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>services rendered at some
indefinite time or place (possibly forgotten or disputed by its
recipient), and &ldquo;for which the holder has not received the
equivalent to which he is inherently entitled under the system of
division of labor.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1340src" href=
"#xd20e1340" name="xd20e1340src">3</a> The best money, therefore,
according to the philosophers of this idea, was an evidence that some
one person owed some other person; and, consequently, the more debt,
the more money; and the more money, the more wealth, unless it is to be
supposed (as is not reasonable) that this sort of money was not to have
the first attribute of all other money&mdash;namely, purchasing
power.</p>
<p>Moreover, although the philosophers did not exactly say so, the
inference was also legitimate, that in a community using merely
&ldquo;token&rdquo; or &ldquo;remembrance&rdquo; money, the surest way
to get rich would be to get in debt, and the best way of carrying on an
enlightened system of trade and commerce, to exchange commodities, the
results of time and labor, for evidences of debt without interest. It
is needless to say that these teachings and inferences tended to
greatly strengthen the people on the island in the opinion they before
entertained, that the currency they already had&mdash;namely, evidences
of destruction&mdash;was the &ldquo;best currency the world ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three leaders among the philosophers were not, however, men who
were going to be contented with any half-way measures. Had they not put
their hands to the plow of reform? and were they, after so doing, to
allow the plow to stick fast in the furrow? They accordingly appealed
first to authority, and then to untutored reason.</p>
<p>The following are some of the authorities to which great weight was

<p>But the thing which the philosophers relied on more than any thing
else to sustain their views before the people was a judicial decision
recently made in a neighboring country, by its highest court, before
whom the question as to what constituted money was officially brought
for determination. This decision, expressed in the very peculiar
language of the country, was as follows: &ldquo;What we do assert is,
that Congress has power to enact that the Government promises to pay
money <i>shall be</i>, for the time being, equivalent in value to the
representative of value determined by the coinage acts, or to multiples
thereof.&rdquo; All of which, translated into the language of the
island, meant that Government has the power to make a promise to pay,
containing an acknowledgment in itself that the promise has not been
paid, a full satisfaction that the promise has been paid. That this
decision, furthermore, covered no new points of law, was indirectly
conceded by the learned judges, inasmuch as, in giving their opinions,
they cited, as precedents worthy of being ever remembered, the
decisions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>of that eminent old-time jurist, Cade (Jack), who
ordained that &ldquo;seven half-penny loaves should be sold for a
penny;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the three-hooped pot shall have ten
hoops.&rdquo; The same court also strengthened its position by saying
that &ldquo;it is hardly correct to speak of a standard of value. The
Constitution does not speak of it. Value is an <i>ideal</i> thing. The
coinage acts fix its unit as a dollar; but the gold and silver thing we
call a dollar is in no sense the standard of a dollar. It is a
representative of it. There might never have been a piece of money of
the denomination of a dollar.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1392src" href="#xd20e1392" name="xd20e1392src">4</a></p>
<p>[<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;This last remark of the learned
court embodied a great discovery; for how can there be a representative
without something to represent? In the case of Peter Schlemihl, there
was a man without a shadow; but here we have a shadow without any
substance to make it. A gold dollar is not a specific and mechanically
formed coin; but 25.8 grains of standard gold is a dollar. Did the
court mean that these grains of gold may never have existed, and yet
have representatives?&mdash;<i>Author.</i>]</p>
<p>The moment this decision was received, all the philosophers got down
their dictionaries, and searched for the meaning of the word
&ldquo;<i>ideal</i>.&rdquo; As was anticipated, its definition was
found to be &ldquo;visionary;&rdquo; &ldquo;existing in fancy or
imagination only&rdquo; (Webster); and from this time forth there was
no longer any doubt in the minds of the reformers of the truth and
strength of the position they occupied. For, to descend to reasoning,
were not two intricate questions definitely settled by the highest of
human tribunals? 1st. That the representative of a thing may be (and if
those in authority say so, shall be) equivalent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>to the
thing itself. 2d. That value is an ideal thing, and therefore
imagination, which creates all ideal things, can create value.</p>
<p>It followed, of course, that to have and enjoy any thing and every
thing, it is only necessary to create and use its symbol or
representative; and to pay for value received, it is only necessary to
imagine a corresponding and equivalent value, and pass it over in
exchange and settlement. On these conclusions of law and reason, then,
it was decided by the three leaders of the philosophers and their
friends, who had control of the Government, that the future money of
the state should be based. The former inscription on the currency in
use, &ldquo;promise to pay,&rdquo; they were clear, was entirely
unnecessary; for why promise money when the store on hand of money was
to be made practically unlimited, or, at least, always equal to the
wants of every body who desired to have it, whether he traded or not?
Mathematical calculations were also made by a scientist, which proved
that the amount of labor which would be actually saved to the
community, and made available for other purposes, by using something as
money which cost little or no labor to produce, in place of gold or
commodities which represented much labor, would be so great as to
require the immediate enactment of a law prohibiting any one from
working over six hours per day, in order to guard against the evil of
too great abundance. The same scientist had previously been so carried
away by his demonstrations of the utility of a new stove which saved
half the fuel, that he had recommended the purchase of two stoves in
order to save the whole.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, to be hereafter noted, the whole population of
the island were jubilant, and proceeded as rapidly as circumstances
would permit to adjust all their commercial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>transactions to the new basis. But joy at the
prospect of the coming millennium did not extinguish feelings of
gratitude in the hearts of the people, and they resolved to send ample
testimonials to all, in foreign lands, to whom they had been indebted
for wisdom.</p>
<p>To each of the judges who had so intelligently defined value they
accordingly voted an ideal castle and estate, possession of the same
conferring nobility upon their owner, with the title of &ldquo;<i>Baron
Ideality</i>,&rdquo; to which, by special patent, the recipient was
authorized to use (if he pleased) the prefix of
&ldquo;<i>damn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the most notable advocate, in foreign lands, of the idea of
non-exportable money a gift of one million of &ldquo;instruments of
association,&rdquo; represented by ideal currency, was voted. But as
this currency, both by law and the fitness of things, could not be
exported from the island, it became impossible to pay this gift, and in
its place a letter was written explaining the circumstances, and
requesting that the resolution to pay might be accepted as a
&ldquo;sign of transmission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the eminent financier who defined money, &ldquo;as a sense of
value in reference to currency as compared with commodities,&rdquo;
there was sent a plaster image of the &ldquo;<i>What Is It</i>;&rdquo;
while to his colleague, who had given the opinion that &ldquo;the less
costly the material out of which money was made, the better for the
community which uses it,&rdquo; was sent a large box, containing
contributions of the most worthless things every body could think of,
with a polite note requesting the recipient to make his choice out of
the collection of what seemed to him best adapted as a token, and
forward a detailed report of his experience in attempting to use it as
a representative of unrequited service.</p>

</div>
<p>Pending the slow preparations of the Government of the island
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>to provide the requisite laws for the issue and
use of the new money, various enlightened individuals attempted to
anticipate official legislative action by putting into practical
operation, on their own account, the principles involved in the new
fiscal system. The first of these who thus acted was a secretary for
the interior part of the island, whose chief business <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>was to
supply the heathen&mdash;for whom, it will be remembered, Robinson
Crusoe took up contributions&mdash;with beef. There had been a
suspicion for some time past hanging over this official that the
heathen did not get all the beef that they were entitled to; but the
suspicion probably had no further foundation than the inability of the
heathen to make the sense of completion harmonize with the sign of
transmission. To satisfy the heathen, and at the same time effectually
clear up his character, the official in question now hastened to have
prepared a large number of pictures of fine, fat cattle, which he
dispatched by a Quaker to the heathen, with a request that they would
kill and eat, and be satisfied, adding in a postscript that they would
do well to begin to learn economy by saving the skins. As the Quaker
never came back, it was deemed reasonably certain that, at least, the
first part of the request had been complied with.</p>
<p>The managers of the Island Provident Society also promptly
determined to develop and apply the ideal system in their sphere of
usefulness to the full extent that circumstances permitted. Thus a
large part of the business of this old and respected society was the
distribution of clothing to the destitute; and, as is always the case
when times are hard, the extent of the demands made upon it for aid
tended to exceed the means of supply contributed by the charitable. The
managers, however, knew that it never would answer in using the ideal
system to subserve the work of charity, to put the locally needy on the
same footing as the heathen, and in answer to appeals for raiment
distribute to them elaborate pictures of fine clothing, cut from the
fashion-plates; for there was this essential difference in the
situations, that the needy were at their doors, while the heathen were
a great way off. They, therefore, hit upon this happy mean: they
employed a competent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"
name="pb94">94</a>]</span>artist, with a full supply of paints and
brushes, and when any destitute person applied for clothing, they
painted upon his person every thing he desired in way of clothing of
the finest and most fashionable patterns, from top-boots to collars,
and from blue swallow-tailed coats to embroidered neck-ties, with
jewelry and fancy buttons to match. Of course, the first man who
appeared in public thus arrayed created a profound sensation. But the
idea was so novel, and had obviously so many advantages over the old
way of clothing one&rsquo;s self, that the supremacy of the ideal over
the real was at once greatly strengthened. For example&mdash;and here
was one of the greatest merits of the new system&mdash;it not only
symbolized, but practically applied, the views of the most advanced
financial philosophers; favored (as the orator-philosopher wished)
&ldquo;more democracy and less aristocracy in the clothes
market;&rdquo; and encouraged the use of the least costly material out
of which the community could make clothes; while the painted cotton,
silk, wool, and leather could be made to look so exactly like the real
articles, that it was only when the attempt was made to exchange the
representative for the real that the difference was clearly
discernible. Furthermore, every garment devised in accordance with the
new system was, in all cases, a perfect fit. The plague of buttons was
annihilated. Every man could save time enough in dressing and
undressing to enrich himself, if he only employed his economized
moments usefully. Every man might, without embarrassment, sleep in his
clothes; and if he desired to change his monkey-jacket <i>three hundred
and sixty-five</i> times in a year for an overcoat, or an overcoat for
a monkey-jacket, he could do it most expeditiously, without the waste
of any raw material more expensive than paint; and thus the system,
after a time, by a happy thought, got the name of the
&ldquo;<i>three-sixty-five interchangeable</i>.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>Of
course, this answered very well so long as the weather continued mild
and pleasant; but later in the season, when it became cool and frosty,
experience soon showed that the warming qualities of different kinds of
paint were not essentially different; that something more than
confidence was necessary to keep out the cold; and that the temperature
and circulation of the body physical remained unaffected, whether a man
painted himself sky-blue one day and pea-green the next.<a class=

<p>Again, two shrewd fellows, Peter von Scrapehem and Israel Double,
owned each a farm worth ten thousand dollars. Peter sold his farm for
its full value to Israel, and took a mortgage for the total
purchase-money; and Israel, in turn, sold his to Peter, and took a
mortgage also for its full value. By so doing, each of these worthy
persons clearly doubled the property in his possession, inasmuch as
while each had at the outset only ten thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of
real estate, each now had ten thousand of real estate and ten thousand
of personal property; or an aggregate of forty thousand between them,
in the place of twenty thousand originally. This method of multiplying
property by multiplying titles was so easy, and the result so apparent,
that the example was very generally followed; and when the census came
to be taken, a few months afterward, all were amazed at the enormous
increase of wealth that had followed the discovery and simple
recognition of the true nature and value of titles. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>Up to this time the supply of milk on the island had been mainly
controlled by a single corporation, which, under the name of the
&ldquo;Lacteal Fluid Association,&rdquo; owned all the cows, and, for
the purpose of facilitating supply, had long been in the habit of
issuing tickets, each good for a pint or a quart of milk, and disposing
of milk to those only who had tickets. These tickets revolved perfectly
in the closed circle of exchange between the milk-men and their
customers, satisfying all demands, and being accepted as the same thing
as milk; for the more tickets, the more milk; and no tickets, no
milk.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1472width" id="p097"><img src="images/p126.png"
alt="Milk-tickets for babies, in place of milk." width="440" height=

<p class="figureHead">Milk-tickets for babies, in place of milk.</p>
</div>
<p>During the war the cannibals, in lack of any other meat, had eaten a
large number of the cows belonging to the &ldquo;Lacteal
Association.&rdquo; Many had been also taken by the Government for the
soldiers; so that after the war was over there were really no more cows
than the island absolutely needed. All at once, the
&ldquo;foot-and-mouth disease&rdquo; invaded the island, and, attacking
every cow belonging to the association, rendered her unable to give
milk. Then arose such a piteous cry from every household where there
were babies as carried a pang to the stoutest hearts. There was no need
of any concerted action, for the people assembled spontaneously and
demanded action. An immense public meeting was at once organized. A
highly popular and humane man, a special friend of children, familiarly
known as Uncle Dick, was called to the chair. He was supported by a
long list of leading citizens as vice-presidents and secretaries, none
of whom, however, had had any practical acquaintance with milk since
their childhood, except in the form of punch. The chairman made an
eloquent speech. He did not know whether he was most agitated by pity
or indignation&mdash;pity for the poor babies, whose sufferings had
become intolerable; indignation at the cruelty of the chartered
monopolists, who had wantonly refused to issue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>more
tickets at the very time when the demand for milk was most imperative.
The assembly was of one mind with the chairman, and unanimously
resolved that the Lacteal Association should immediately increase their
supply of tickets, and that, in default thereof, their charter should
be altered and amended. Unable to resist the storm of popular
indignation, the association at once complied, and every patriotic
citizen went home to the bosom of his afflicted family, carrying an
abundant supply of milk-tickets, and feeling conscious that for once at
least he had risen to the level of the occasion.</p>
<p>That night the babies were all supplied with milk-tickets in the
place of milk. Milk-tickets hot, milk-tickets cold, milk-tickets
sweetened, milk-tickets plain, milk-tickets with their backs printed
green, and interchangeable with milk-tickets drawing cream skimmed from
other milk-tickets. But, strange to say, the babies, one and all, with
that same sort of instinctive perversity which induces children of a
larger growth to refuse to accept shams for reality, and be grateful in
addition, refused to take to milk-tickets. The uproar of the night
preceding was as nothing to the disturbances of the night following,
and morning dawned upon an unrefreshed and troubled population.</p>
<p>As soon as the necessary arrangements could be made, another meeting
assembled. But the meeting this time was composed of babies, backed by
their mammas and nurses. There was no theory in their sentiments; and
though young in years, one and all felt that they had lived long enough
to know what their fathers apparently did not know&mdash;namely, the
difference between milk and paper. The resolutions voted were brief,
but to the point, and were, substantially, as follows:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, that the exigencies of the times demanded more milk,
and not more milk-tickets; <i>second</i>, that the way to get more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>milk was to have more cows; <i>third</i>, that
the way to get more cows was to go to work and raise them, or raise
something else equally valuable, and then with this something else buy
cows; <i>fourth</i>, that there are certain eternal verities against
which it is useless for either babies or men to contend. A committee
was appointed to procure a mill of the gods, to grind up those who
disbelieved in the last resolution, and the meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>This was the first indication of any thing like popular dissent from
the views of the Friends of Humanity. Others, however, soon followed.
Value having been declared to be an ideal thing, and ideal measures of
value having been substituted in the place of the real and tangible
measures formerly in use, it had been deemed proper to substitute ideal
measures of length, weight, and capacity in the place of the
foot-rules, yard-sticks, pound-weights, and bushel-measures formerly
employed. Shop-keepers, plumbers, charcoal-men, gas corporators, and
all others who had any thing to sell accordingly provided themselves
with slips of paper, upon which were printed, respectively, &ldquo;This
is a foot,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a bushel,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a
pint,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a pound;&rdquo; and the services of the
arithmetic-man were again called for, to prove how much more cloth,
beer, charcoal, gas, and all other measurable things the community
would certainly have by the saving of labor and capital contingent on
the avoidance of the necessity of further manufacturing, purchasing,
and using the old measures.</p>
<p>But the new system did not work smoothly. There was no harmony of
sentiment between buyers and sellers; and what was one man&rsquo;s
ideal of what he should give or receive in trade was always different
from every other man&rsquo;s; and, before the community were well aware
of what they were about, they found themselves drifting back to the
adoption of the old system <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>of barter, which had been tried
and abandoned in the early days of the island&rsquo;s history. Instead
of one price, every one who had commodities or services to sell adopted
a scale of at least four prices: &ldquo;pay price,&rdquo; &ldquo;money
price,&rdquo; &ldquo;pay as money price,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;trusting
price;&rdquo; and the seller, before fixing his price, invariably asked
his customer how he would pay.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1505src"
href="#xd20e1505" name="xd20e1505src">6</a> &ldquo;Pay price&rdquo; was
barter; &ldquo;money price&rdquo; was payment in foreign coin;
&ldquo;pay as money&rdquo; was in the ideal money of the island;
&ldquo;trusting&rdquo; was an enhanced price, according to time. Thus,
supposing a customer wanted a knife, its price in &ldquo;pay&rdquo;
would be a bushel of corn; in &ldquo;money price,&rdquo; a fifty-cent
gold or silver coin; in &ldquo;pay as money,&rdquo; sometimes as much
as he could bring in a basket, at other times as much as he could bring
in a wheelbarrow; and before the ultimate abandonment of the use of
ideal money, a cart had to be employed to bring the money. Trade in
this way became &ldquo;most intricate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News also came, about this time, that the heathen, not being able to
stay their stomachs with the pictures of fat cattle that had been so
abundantly sent them, and considering themselves humbugged, were
preparing to declare war. To meet a threatened increased expenditure on
this account, the Government, therefore, levied new taxes; and as the
valuation of the property of the island, under the influence of the new
fiscal system, had, as before stated, enormously increased, it was
anticipated that a small rate would yield a large revenue. But as soon
as Scrapehem, Double, and their friends, who had been multiplying their
property by multiplying titles, found <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>out that the titles
were to be valued and assessed as wealth, equally with the property
which the titles represented, they hasted to swap back, and cancel
their mortgages; and immediately half the reputed wealth of the island
disappeared.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e1512width" id="p102"><img src="images/p130.png"
alt="An inflation look ahead." width="435" height="492">
<p class="figureHead">An inflation look ahead.</p>
</div>
<p>There were some people, it will be remembered, who did not share in
the general jubilation which welcomed the discovery and adoption of the
new monetary system. These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>were the stony-hearted
capitalists, meaning thereby persons who had produced by industry and
frugality more than they had consumed, and had lent out this surplus in
the form of ships, houses, horses and carts, wheelbarrows, coal, iron,
and the like, on condition that they should be repaid the value of the
several articles as expressed in money, with a portion of the profit
that might have accrued to the borrower from their using.</p>
<p>There was a popular feeling that all these lenders were
&ldquo;bloated,&rdquo; the degrees of bloat being, of course, different
all the way from the man who owned and lent a ship down to the man who
owned and lent a cart, or their equivalents in money; and that the best
remedy for this frightful disease was tapping, and tapping by tendering
in payment the ideal money, which was something very different in value
from the money understood at the time the loans were effected. Natives
of heathen lands, who had never enjoyed the light of the Gospel, called
this robbing; but many on the island who had always been Christians
regarded the matter with indifference, and treated it as a purely
sanitary measure; and Christian ministers who never preached against
such practices, but always did preach against the sins of that ancient
people, the Jews, wondered at the low tone of morality that seemed to
generally characterize society. As it appears, however, from an
examination of the ancient records of the island, that strenuous
exertions were made about this time to interest the Government and the
people in the momentous question of the reading of the Bible in the
public schools, and thus prevent public attention from being diverted
to the consideration of any such unimportant and side issues as the
nature and obligations of promises, it may be that the low tone of
morality thus referred to was more apparent than real; no province
devolving upon the historian being more difficult than that of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>attempting to reconcile, after a long lapse of
years, what appears to be a series of contemporaneous but utterly
incongruous circumstances.</p>
<p>But, be this as it may, all who had loaned valuable commodities
desired to avoid tapping, and consequently hastened to demand repayment
before the ideal money could be extensively issued and put into
circulation; and, having once obtained payment, were very cautious how
they lent again. All this contributed, in the language of the day, to
make money very tight; but this language had, to a great extent, no
meaning. The only money that was tight was good money, and this had
been gone so long that the younger part of the population didn&rsquo;t
even know how it looked; while of the bad money there was a continually
increasing quantity.</p>
<p>Besides good money, all real capital, timber for building ships,
factories, and houses, iron for the construction of machinery, cloth
for clothes, and grain for food, were tight; not because there was any
lack of all these useful things, but because the owners had all become
afraid that if they once loaned or parted with them they should never
receive back an equivalent. So the island, instead of being lifted up
to great prosperity, was plunged into the depths of adversity. There
was a general lack of confidence. Societary activity was abated;
production was arrested; and men desirous of being industrious had no
opportunity of following any industry.</p>
<p>Gold had long disappeared from circulation. Although produced in
large quantities on the island, none of it would stay there, but flowed
off to foreign countries in a steady stream. The common explanation of
this phenomenon was, that gold had become the cheapest thing the island
produced, and was, therefore, the first thing exported. But a majority
of those who said and heard this did not clearly see that the average
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>purchasing power of gold the world over had not
varied in any degree; but that the price of almost every other thing
produced on the island had so varied and relatively increased, by
reason of domestic fiscal circumstances, that it was far better for the
foreigner to take pay in gold for all the commodities he sold to the
island, and then, with this gold, purchase in other countries the very
things which the island specially produced and wanted to sell. As
already intimated, the islanders found great difficulty in
understanding this little arrangement; but the foreigners understood it
as by intuition, and never failed to act upon it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1533src" href="#xd20e1533" name="xd20e1533src">7</a> All of this
further contributed to turn upside down and inside out the industries
of the island; and while the Friends of Humanity continued to loudly
proclaim that the issue of more money would cure all difficulties, the
people, sorely distressed, and ready to accept relief from any quarter,
began to loudly murmur, in turn, at what seemed an unnecessary delay in
making the issue; the fact being, that although public opinion was
nearly unanimous on the subject, the regular time for the Congress of
the island to meet and enact the laws had not come round.</p>
<p>At last, the long-expected day arrived, and Congress assembled. All
the special and immediate Friends of &ldquo;More Money,&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Ideal Money,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Humanity,&rdquo; were members;
and hardly had the presiding officer taken his seat before fifty men
sprung for the floor, each with a resolution demanding immediate fiscal
legislation. The first resolution adopted was, that the Government
should at once supply all the money <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>which the wants of
every body, and every trade and industry, might, could, would, or
should require; and that the money thus issued should be a legal tender
for the payment of all debts, past, present, and prospective.</p>

<p><i>Labor.</i> &ldquo;But when I go to buy bread I find them only
worth one; so I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The next important question was, In what manner should <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>the
new and unlimited supply of money be distributed? All saw at once that
it would never do to commence on a system of giving unlimited something
for unlimited nothing; and yet, if this was not done, how was it
possible for the wants of those who had nothing, and who, of course,
wanted money for this reason most imperatively, to be supplied?
Besides, to create an unlimited supply of the new money, it would be
necessary to have a good many hundreds of thousands of slips of paper
with the words, &ldquo;This is a dollar,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is ten
dollars,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is&mdash;&rdquo; (some other amount),
properly and artistically printed on them; all of which, in turn, would
require a great expenditure, not only of ink and paper, but also of
time; while the necessity of the hour was for immediate relief,
especially to trade. It was therefore decided to leave the troublesome
question of equal distribution for a time unsettled, and endeavor to
first relieve trade by doubling the volume of the currency. And in
order to do this at once, and without cost to the Government for
engraving, printing, paper, and ink, it was therefore enacted that
every one having legal-tender currency might cut or divide the same
into two equal halves or pieces, and that each of these halves or
pieces so resulting should be a legal tender to the full amount that
the whole had previously been. At first thought, this proposition to
exclude all those who had no money from participation in the new supply
seemed most palpably unfair and unjust, but a little consideration
satisfied to the contrary; for unless it was proposed to give away the
new money, it was obvious that those only would get it who had money,
and that the proportion which all such would obtain would be in
proportion to what money they already had. It was, therefore, deemed
wise to anticipate what was certain to be the ultimate result, and
distribute it in the manner indicated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was expected that this new and immense volume of
currency, poured at once on to the wheels of trade, would immediately
start the wheels. But, somehow, it didn&rsquo;t seem to have that
effect at all. The wheels not only would not revolve, but the friction
on them seemed to have become more persistent and chronic than ever. In
fact, the doubling the volume of the currency, instead of increasing
the before existing instrumentalities for facilitating exchanges, had
really diminished them; for all who were willing to exchange
commodities for the new currency either doubled the price of their
commodities, or gave only half the quantity for what they regarded as
half of the former money; so that with all this class the abundance of
currency was relatively the same as before. But the majority who had
any thing to sell would not accept the ideal money in exchange at all.
They did not claim, they said, to be financiers, or philosophers, or
even special friends of humanity; but they did think that they were not
such fools that they could be made to believe that the half of a thing
was equal to the whole, or that one bushel of grain could be converted
into two by putting one bushel into two half-bushel measures.</p>
<p>The only really positive effect of the doubling of the volume of the
currency in the manner authorized by law was, therefore, to scale all
debts to the extent of fifty per cent., and in such a manner that
creditors were wholly unable to help <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>themselves; for by
terms of the act every one dollar of old legal tender was now made two
for all new legal-tender purposes. In this way the people on the island
soon learned a most important elementary lesson in finance, which was,
that the only one attribute of legal tender which is imperative and
unavoidable<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1569src" href="#xd20e1569" name=
"xd20e1569src">1</a> is its inherent power of canceling or liquidating
debts or of tapping creditors&mdash;and this, too, irrespective of the
endowment of the legal tender with any real or representative value. So
that a truthful designation of the act in question would have been
&ldquo;An act to relieve debtors from half of their obligations, and
swindle creditors to a corresponding extent of what was due them by the
debtor&rsquo;s acknowledgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the credit of the people of the island it must be recorded that,
as a general rule, they were too honorable to take advantage of the law
to do so wrong and mean a thing;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1574src"
href="#xd20e1574" name="xd20e1574src">2</a> but the knowledge that
every debtor had it in his power to so act, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>and
the fear that some would take advantage of their unquestionable legal
privileges, contributed still further to bring all business to a
stand-still.</p>
<p>There was also a curious phenomenon incident to the situation, and
pertaining to the rate of interest, which excited no little comment and
attention. Every body took it for granted that with an unlimited supply
of money a low rate of interest would prevail, and that, however much
the financiers and philosophers might disagree about other things, this
one result would be certain. An eminently practical man in one of the
public debating societies of the island thought he had definitely, and
for all time, settled the question by authoritatively remarking that
&ldquo;an abundance of money does produce enterprise, prosperity, and
progress;&rdquo; &ldquo;that when money was plenty interest would be
lower,&rdquo; just as when horses and hogs are abundant, horses and
hogs would be cheap. He, for one, &ldquo;put aside all these old
theories, these platitudes of finance.&rdquo; There was &ldquo;no
vitality in them.&rdquo; He preferred &ldquo;to take the actual
results, and the actual condition of the country, and let theory go to
the dogs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1581src" href="#xd20e1581"
name="xd20e1581src">3</a></p>
<p>There was so much of originality and home sense in these remarks, so
much of a lordly contemning of the teachings of musty old experience,
that the friends of the orator thought him much more worthy than ever
of the executive chair formerly filled by the wise Robinson Crusoe.
But, unfortunately for the orator, he hadn&rsquo;t got far enough along
in his financial primer to appreciate the difference between capital
and currency; and in the simplicity of his heart imagined that it was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>all the same, whether we had pictures of horses,
hogs, and money, or real horses, hogs, and money, which represent and
are accumulated by labor. So the things which he thus settled in
opposition to theory and experience wouldn&rsquo;t stay settled; and
the islanders in due time came to a realizing sense of the following
truths: that the more of a redundant, irredeemable paper that is
issued, the more it depreciates, and the more it is depreciated, the
more there is required of it to transact business; and that if any one
borrows depreciated money to do any thing, he has to borrow a greater
nominal amount than he would of money that was not depreciated; and
that it is on <i>the number</i> of nominal dollars, and <i>not on their
purchasing power</i>, that the rate of interest is always calculated.
The invariable rise in prices consequent on the depreciation of money
(price as already explained being the purchasing power of any commodity
or service expressed in money), furthermore stimulates borrowing for
the purpose of speculation; and the more borrowers, the more
competition; and the more the competition to obtain an article or
service, the higher the price demanded for it.</p>
<p>Again, the currency of the island having been made artificially
abundant, its exchangeable value was always uncertain; and capital,
therefore, as it always does at such times, locked up its pockets,
hesitated to take risks, and, if it consented to loan at all, demanded
extra pay by reason of the increased risk or induced scarcity.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1596src" href="#xd20e1596" name="xd20e1596src">4</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>After testing all these principles experimentally for a considerable
time, the people on the island came to see that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>possession of money was the consequence rather
than the cause of wealth; and that, except under special circumstances
and conditions, the rate of interest depends on the abundance or
scarcity of that part of the capital of a community which does not
consist of money; and that it can not be permanently lowered by any
increase in the quantity of money.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1618src"
href="#xd20e1618" name="xd20e1618src">5</a></p>
<p>In this way, through the school of hard experience, the people on
the island came gradually to understand that there were certain
economic truths which had got to be accepted and lived up to in order
to insure either individual or national prosperity. They came to
understand that property is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>physical actuality, the
result of some form of labor; that capital is that portion of the
results of production which can be reserved and made available for new
and further production; that money is an instrumentality for
facilitating the distribution and use of capital and the interchange of
products and services; that production alone buys production; that when
one buys goods with a paper representative or symbol of money, the
goods are not paid for until the representative is substituted by a
value of some sort in labor, or money, or some other commodity; and,
finally, that a country and its inhabitants increase in wealth or
abundance by increasing their products, rather than by inordinately
multiplying machinery for the exchange of products. They also saw that
the promises to pay which they had been using and regarding as money
were debts; and that debts, as well as all other forms of title, are
but shadows of the property they represent; and that, in endeavoring to
all get rich by first creating debts, then calling the debts money, and
the money wealth, they had been led, successively, into speculation,
extravagance, idleness, and impoverishment; and, like the dog in the
fable, which let go of the meat in crossing a stream for the sake of
grasping its shadow, they had lost much of real wealth resulting from
previous industry by trying to make the shadow of wealth supply the
place of its substance.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The hungry dog and the shadow.</p>
<p class="first">Grasp at the Shadow and lose the Substance.</p>
</div>
<p>Coming to gradually realize, also, that one of the first requisites
for an increase of trade was that confidence should exist between the
buyer and the seller, but that such confidence never would exist so
long as the representatives of value, or other intermediate agencies
made use of for facilitating exchanges, were of an uncertain,
fluctuating character, they also came finally to the conclusion that
there was no economy in using cheap money; or, in other words, that the
loss and waste inevitably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>resulting from the use of poor
tools (money being a tool) was many times in excess of the interest
accruing from any increased cost of good tools. So reasoning, gold, or
undoubted promises to pay gold, gradually came once more into use as
money on the island. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>There were some prophecies, and a good deal of apprehension, that
there would be difficulty experienced in obtaining sufficient gold to
serve as money or as a basis for currency, especially when it was
remembered that the influence of all that had recently happened had
been to encourage the export of all the gold that was owned or produced
on the island. But as the goldsmiths and the jewelers never experienced
any difficulty during the war with the cannibals, or afterward, in
obtaining all the gold they wanted, no matter how scarce and valuable
it was as compared with currency, and could have had a hundred times
more than they actually used, if their customers had been willing to
pay for it; so the merchants, traders, and people at large on the
island, as soon as they became satisfied that it was economical to use
gold, and determined to have it, experienced no difficulty in obtaining
an ample supply.</p>
<p>One circumstance which, pending this result, tended to greatly
relieve the popular apprehension on this score, was the reading in
foreign newspapers that the people in certain comparatively poor
countries&mdash;as Oregon, Arizona, Nevada, and Washington
Territory&mdash;had no more difficulty in obtaining and retaining all
the gold that they found it desirable to use for the purpose of money,
than they had in obtaining and retaining all the wheelbarrows and
steam-engines that they desired to use in conducting their business;
and laughed when any body talked of depriving them of their gold
money.</p>
<p>The first step having been thus taken in the right direction, a
sequence of other proper acts occurred as naturally and with the same
favorable results as in the celebrated case of the old woman and the
kid; in which it will be remembered that as soon as the water began to
quench the fire, the fire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>began to burn the stick, the stick
began to beat the dog, the dog began to bite the kid, and, as a
consequence of this sequence and its concluding act, the old woman got
safely home with the kid, though at a period of the evening much later
than was desirable or proper. And so, by a succession of events,
prosperity slowly but surely came back to the island.</p>
<p>As for the Friends of Humanity, who had been the authors of so much
financial and commercial disturbance and national misfortune, they soon
ceased to command attention from any one, then became objects of
laughter and derision, and finally passed out of the remembrance of the
people, who were now all too busy in restoring their fortunes to give a
thought to bygone and mortifying experiences. Some became convinced of
their errors, and made good citizens; but in the case of the majority,
the belief that the calling of things of no intrinsic value by the name
of money was equivalent to the creation of wealth, became chronic, and
finally developed into a harmless insanity. On pleasant days they might
often be seen on the corners of the streets gathering leaves and bits
of sticks and straws, and telling the children that assembled about
them that all that was necessary to make these worthless gatherings
money was to simply have confidence that they were so. But this was
asking for a simplicity of belief that was a little too much, even for
the children.</p>
<p>It only remains to add that, as memorials of this eventful history,
there is still exhibited in one of the public buildings on the island
an exact model of the cave in which the venerable Robinson Crusoe
dwelt, and, what is even more interesting, the identical chest which he
brought from the ship, and which contained the pins, needles, knives,
cloth, and scissors, and the three great bags of what was then useless,
but now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>good and true, money. Numerous specimens of the
&ldquo;ideal money&rdquo; may also be seen in the same room, together
with a picture of the barber who papered his shop with it, and of the
dog which the people paraded in the streets covered with a plaster of
pitch and currency.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1651src" href=

"xd20e1569" href="#xd20e1569src" name="xd20e1569">1</a></span> This is
the American interpretation. The English interpretation of &ldquo;legal
tender&rdquo; was brought out in a debate in the House of Lords, in
June, 1811, when it was shown to mean, in its application to Great
Britain, no more than this: that in a suit between creditor and debtor,
if a judgment went against the debtor, he was allowed to plead a tender
of bank-notes in arrest of execution, but he could not claim that the
notes should be forced upon the creditor in discharge of the debt.
During the long suspension of specie payments in Great Britain,
therefore, bank-notes were never made legal tender in the American
sense.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1574" href="#xd20e1574src" name="xd20e1574">2</a></span> After
the Revolutionary war it was considered disgraceful to take advantage
of the legal-tender character of the depreciated Continental or State
paper money to liquidate debts with it; and the Society of Cincinnati
expelled a member for so doing. The State of Rhode Island also, which
longer than any of the other States endeavored to maintain by law the
legal-tender character and use of such money, was often spoken of in
consequence as &ldquo;Rogue&rsquo;s&rdquo; in place of
&ldquo;Rhode&rdquo; Island.</p>

who may desire to know how far imagination has been drawn upon for this
picture, reference is made to the speech of Hon. O. P. Morton, United
States Senate, &ldquo;Congressional Record,&rdquo; vol. ii., part i.,
Forty-third Congress, First Session, p. 669.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1596" href="#xd20e1596src" name="xd20e1596">4</a></span> The
pertinacity &ldquo;with which a mind befogged on the subject of money
and currency holds on to the delusion that the making and issue of
promises to pay, and calling the same money, is equivalent to the
creation of wealth; and, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, that the cancellation
or withdrawal, by payment, of such promises is the same thing as the
destruction of wealth, and also tends to make money&mdash;in the sense
of capital&mdash;scarce, and interest high, finds many amusing
illustrations, which for educational purposes are better than
arguments.</p>
<p class="footnote">For example, we have, first, the assumption of a
leading Senator of the United States (already referred to, and which,
if not on record, would seem incredible) that because an increased
supply of horses and hogs made available to a market make horses and
hogs cheap, therefore an increased supply of evidences that capital had
been borrowed, used, and never paid, would tend to increase the
quantity and rate of interest of loanable capital. A corresponding
illustration is also to be found in the case of the member of the
Continental Congress mentioned by Pelatiah Webster, who, when the
subject of increased taxation for the support of the war was under
consideration, indignantly asked &ldquo;if he was expected to help tax
the people, when they could go to the printing-office and get money by
the cart-load?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">The experience of the Irish mob also finds an
appropriate place under this head, which made a bonfire of all the
notes issued by an obnoxious private banker that they could gather,
little imagining, as they shouted and capered with wild delight about
the fire that consumed them, that, in place of impoverishing, they were
really enriching, their enemy.</p>
<p class="footnote">The following story, also illustrative of the same
popular fallacy, passes current in one of the towns of Eastern
Connecticut: During the severe financial panic of 1857, an honest
country farmer and deacon, who, by virtue of being a considerable
stockholder in one of the local banks, had been placed as a figure-head
on its board of directors, was applied to by a farmer friend to help
him in procuring from the bank a small loan. Knowing that the times
were hard, and money scarce, the deacon, although desirous of obliging
his friend, did not at once commit himself, but promised to go to the
bank, and make his action contingent upon the state of affairs which he
might there find. The two friends, accordingly, went into town the next
day (which happened to be the culminating day of the crisis, when every
promise to pay issued by any bank was, in the general distrust,
gathered up and rushed in for redemption); and, while the applicant for
the loan waited outside, the director entered the bank to reconnoitre.
Passing into the directors&rsquo; room, and thence behind the counter,
he said little, but, keeping his eyes wide open, did not fail to notice
the extraordinarily large packages of bills, filling safe and drawers,
which, to the annoyance and strain of the bank, had been recently sent
in for payment. Seeking no further proof of the financial strength of
his institution, he returned to the street, and, informing his friend
that every thing was all right, the latter next entered, and
confidently asked for his discount. To his great surprise, he received
the usual polite answer, that &ldquo;they would be too glad to oblige
him, but that, really, they had no money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Out of
money!&rdquo; said the deacon, when the result of the application was
made known to him. &ldquo;Out of money! How can they lie so, when I
have just seen the safe and drawers full of it? As a Christian man, and
an officer of the church, I can&rsquo;t conscientiously be a director
and stockholder any longer in such an immoral institution.&rdquo; And
yet, if, on returning home, the good deacon had found in his
table-drawer a number of his individual promissory-notes, signed and
ready to issue, but not issued, he would not have thought himself any
richer by their existence, but, on the contrary, would have felt much
more comfortable at such a time to know that the notes were all under
double-lock security, or, better, if he saw them vanishing into ashes.
And yet, in the case of the bank-notes, he couldn&rsquo;t understand
why they were not money, to be used at all times and under all
circumstances!</p>
